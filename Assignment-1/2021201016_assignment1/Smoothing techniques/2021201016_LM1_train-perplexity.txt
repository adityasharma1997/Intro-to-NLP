it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	pp=4.060293132610215
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters	pp=4.172062178846393
bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last mr	pp=3.351205668232167
bennet replied that he had not	pp=2.536252309503624
long has just been here and she told me all about it mr	pp=2.851216475725111
bennet made no answer	pp=1.124592230141505
do not you want to know who has taken it	pp=3.306467504558344
cried his wife impatiently	pp=1.681388247798568
_you_ want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it	pp=3.5894996286369927
why my dear you must know mrs	pp=3.210815428935202
long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr	pp=3.7802885885786575
morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week	pp=4.583434812887231
what is his name bingley	pp=1.7379755073855165
is he married or single	pp=1.7320523746566043
oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year	pp=3.6624701356794405
what a fine thing for our girls  how so	pp=2.4896290270014068
how can it affect them	pp=1.732485548775816
my dear mr	pp=2.9555888401573216
bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them	pp=4.0464599056668495
is that his design in settling here	pp=2.1776881639586962
design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes	pp=5.234085726562978
i see no occasion for that	pp=1.907623665784279
you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr	pp=4.064233162863873
bingley might like you the best of the party	pp=2.5345146673253707
my dear you flatter me	pp=2.2871715743299723
i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now	pp=3.6182149913471955
when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty	pp=3.739271153596131
in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of	pp=3.091821879761195
it is more than i engage for i assure you	pp=3.2819449997521377
but consider your daughters	pp=1.413258432067572
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers	pp=3.5531227205628406
indeed you must go for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not	pp=3.170112765870592
i dare say mr	pp=2.8466071481868824
bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy	pp=4.23697589557578
i desire you will do no such thing	pp=2.7977550188979285
lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia	pp=4.217621699455106
but you are always giving _her_ the preference	pp=2.7637108975702858
they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters mr	pp=3.791615104364415
bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way	pp=3.69161291194486
you take delight in vexing me	pp=1.9606660261811792
i have a high respect for your nerves	pp=2.798571309790984
they are my old friends	pp=1.7396006669703727
ah you do not know what i suffer	pp=3.519362352163443
but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood	pp=3.696403033171869
depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all mr	pp=3.8467763350297868
_her_ mind was less difficult to develope	pp=2.152458307600138
she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper	pp=3.2344605566749287
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous	pp=2.8770326172187737
the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news chapter ii mr	pp=3.072573005711182
bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley	pp=2.9906376628596494
it was then disclosed in the following manner	pp=2.5145677207102364
bingley will like it lizzy	pp=1.7175623381346197
but you forget mama said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs	pp=3.2852389380540474
long has promised to introduce him	pp=1.9321290974274357
i do not believe mrs	pp=2.888941271103076
long will do any such thing	pp=1.9872589142291628
she has two nieces of her own	pp=2.129928082743858
she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her	pp=4.189244913588825
no more have i said mr	pp=1.9621901444741465
bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you mrs	pp=5.204598730197868
bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters	pp=3.522389651371689
you tear them to pieces	pp=1.6859567229460533
kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill	pp=3.158372606139044
i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully	pp=3.8504524525395376
aye so it is cried her mother and mrs	pp=3.2597875107740344
long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself	pp=4.2334485948147575
then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr	pp=3.7842565588813475
bingley to _her_ impossible mr	pp=1.7264830640695599
bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing	pp=4.2373513007326915
i honour your circumspection	pp=1.4141322943272667
a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little	pp=2.188307791105729
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight	pp=2.742134863665079
but if _we_ do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs	pp=2.9970392013045597
long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself	pp=3.5237634851441837
the girls stared at their father mrs	pp=2.1826129969608266
bennet said only nonsense nonsense  what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he	pp=3.1925585914540164
do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense	pp=2.9768800569202494
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts	pp=3.7687170071869622
mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how	pp=3.1186334853981665
while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr bingley	pp=2.8891113743076215
i am sick of mr	pp=1.6325811443498381
bingley cried his wife	pp=1.4138151709096514
i am sorry to hear _that_ but why did not you tell me so before	pp=3.481040161717962
if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him	pp=4.128996267823127
it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now	pp=3.939454050679736
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while	pp=4.7593093923637415
bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last	pp=2.767109195409564
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance	pp=3.1119228618186163
well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now	pp=4.087708693495435
now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr	pp=2.8539595359510437
bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife	pp=3.3585945297066138
what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut	pp=3.382306428286487
i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter	pp=3.6011602727655156
at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing	pp=4.030062736653828
bingley will dance with you at the next ball	pp=2.567384567276363
oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i _am_ the youngest im the tallest	pp=3.3620015108214387
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr	pp=3.2332945532855635
bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner chapter iii	pp=3.168440107674807
not all that mrs	pp=1.4092313755277863
bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley	pp=3.827325189873511
sir william had been delighted with him	pp=2.177012924568798
he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party	pp=3.7589711911874373
nothing could be more delightful to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr	pp=3.641894090535823
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs	pp=3.3327254533068276
bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for	pp=4.438756245180563
in a few days mr	pp=2.4904711777417057
bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library	pp=3.5911733859441504
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father	pp=4.008099524621273
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse	pp=3.6834150908192815
bennet was quite disconcerted	pp=1.6815052347820998
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be	pp=4.4702173442201785
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr	pp=4.127924152353105
bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	pp=3.2938456188001886
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin	pp=3.7624810192813176
bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man mr	pp=3.076178627877255
bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners	pp=3.2162033476429426
his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion	pp=3.1683827297398754
his brotherinlaw mr	pp=1.95827739386057
hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr	pp=2.44354172355184
darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year	pp=3.815639950147103
bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend mr	pp=3.9314809394847896
bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield	pp=3.9354570409927616
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves	pp=2.4124177999759917
what a contrast between him and his friend mr	pp=3.292901344063928
darcy danced only once with mrs	pp=1.9735605168566142
hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party	pp=4.3317411267819015
his character was decided	pp=1.8600908353149825
he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again	pp=3.8139818866013036
amongst the most violent against him was mrs	pp=2.343613964586615
bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters	pp=3.262387723272671
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr	pp=3.72543519451759
bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it	pp=3.172250940544754
come darcy said he i must have you dance	pp=3.118344117095013
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner	pp=3.1787056762693684
you had much better dance	pp=1.9966778371096687
at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable	pp=4.044824952930578
i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty	pp=4.299921283814971
_you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr	pp=3.3963805373559826
darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet	pp=1.8999050660669876
oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable	pp=4.495381539089498
do let me ask my partner to introduce you	pp=2.448026198910385
which do you mean	pp=1.4137973298460218
and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men	pp=4.342102962509524
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me mr	pp=3.4233174489830724
bingley followed his advice mr	pp=1.7260219106001453
darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him	pp=2.832883708350138
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous	pp=3.7583525733476577
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrs	pp=3.049367244508604
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party mr	pp=3.143641361205754
bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters	pp=3.659953765095211
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way	pp=3.672545878461982
elizabeth felt janes pleasure	pp=1.4122717850384834
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball	pp=4.500607964161172
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants	pp=3.2194375449719566
they found mr	pp=2.232600202109382
bennet still up	pp=2.2756314258413615
with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations	pp=4.233874052176565
he had rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear	pp=4.31084959331966
oh my dear mr	pp=2.2067843116580996
bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball	pp=3.597267573005947
i wish you had been there	pp=1.5983356990999693
jane was so admired nothing could be like it	pp=2.8065521792716197
every body said how well she looked and mr	pp=2.6501150411064502
bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice	pp=2.290692566481456
only think of _that_ my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time	pp=3.9812056195812078
then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger  if he had had any compassion for _me_ cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for gods sake say no more of his partners	pp=4.45687326463035
oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance  oh my dear continued mrs	pp=4.653789027976602
bennet i am quite delighted with him	pp=3.419673859010369
he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women	pp=3.22627790527391
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses	pp=2.8112681938583055
hursts gown  here she was interrupted again mr	pp=2.3264866745240598
bennet protested against any description of finery	pp=2.1572173367192393
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy	pp=3.5480343861037005
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing	pp=4.07190742125866
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs	pp=3.9374077965885186
i quite detest the man chapter iv	pp=2.1497178798738568
when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr	pp=3.7043960527602975
he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy mannersso much ease with such perfect good breeding  he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can	pp=4.242460006955859
his character is thereby complete	pp=1.740770255561637
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time	pp=2.932932097309614
i did not expect such a compliment	pp=3.4685108776258433
did not you	pp=2.8098695340375834
_i_ did for you	pp=1.397834908133833
but that is one great difference between us	pp=2.8840577612664977
compliments always take _you_ by surprise and _me_ never	pp=2.661373194341227
what could be more natural than his asking you again	pp=2.827968284016317
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room	pp=4.189230869471698
no thanks to his gallantry for that	pp=2.1529933886438677
you have liked many a stupider person	pp=2.404581346252874
dear lizzy  oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general	pp=3.8863088813200886
you never see a fault in any body	pp=2.321366049941196
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	pp=3.272196484604084
i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think	pp=4.040616436722749
i know you do and it is _that_ which makes the wonder	pp=3.7677268591178366
with _your_ good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enoughone meets it every where	pp=3.6698996434829474
but to be candid without ostentation or designto take the good of every bodys character and make it still better and say nothing of the badbelongs to you alone	pp=3.6881953951968085
and so you like this mans sisters too do you	pp=2.61409578188238
their manners are not equal to his	pp=2.3378732090071113
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them	pp=2.871138265644271
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her	pp=4.236321945904325
elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them	pp=4.5199397283684775
they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited	pp=4.051384907696959
they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others	pp=4.141524913045382
they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade mr	pp=3.6483286989033776
bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do itmr	pp=3.4162159690106617
bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase	pp=4.114077175842131
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs	pp=4.5420458328358775
hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her mr	pp=3.589133845250691
bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house	pp=3.90008301178739
he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately	pp=3.6514363610373706
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of characterbingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied	pp=4.474090094956988
on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion	pp=3.5349051563095237
bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever	pp=2.8714056514394146
he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting	pp=3.1281728149055943
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	pp=3.0852105457860377
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence	pp=3.2183711824153542
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic	pp=3.351376309198902
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful	pp=4.465852373161333
darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure	pp=4.135422981415589
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much mrs	pp=3.134883839808656
hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of	pp=4.523990720857455
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose chapter v	pp=3.891147964462534
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate	pp=3.476292347584226
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty	pp=3.908498089471309
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	pp=2.369195731087052
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world	pp=4.138456411412651
for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body	pp=3.7002127696078464
by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st	pp=2.340897452762621
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs	pp=3.9977784458859684
bennetthey had several children	pp=1.4136906803713338
the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was elizabeths intimate friend	pp=2.993536258298871
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate	pp=4.022064550629141
bennet with civil selfcommand to miss lucas	pp=2.144702730295155
_you_ were mr	pp=1.573991148569404
bingleys first choice	pp=1.5868903740159865
yesbut he seemed to like his second better	pp=2.5256247953464315
to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe he _did_i heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomething about mr robinson	pp=4.283302812001374
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr	pp=2.9251748939912017
robinson did not i mention it to you mr	pp=2.8983017652133833
robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and _which_ he thought the prettiest	pp=4.664679572698752
and his answering immediately to the last questionoh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point	pp=3.395021684438971
upon my wordwell that was very decided indeedthat does seem as ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know	pp=3.1958838259422557
_my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_ eliza said charlotte mr	pp=2.9678088257828286
darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is hepoor elizato be only just _tolerable_	pp=3.6924912314074056
i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs	pp=4.446184157201136
long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	pp=3.77480845370692
are you quite sure maamis not there a little mistake	pp=2.544293183224453
said janei certainly saw mr	pp=1.7257880204144
darcy speaking to her	pp=1.3871771300996152
ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering herbut she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to	pp=4.061099087558054
miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance	pp=3.5984862111114237
with _them_ he is remarkably agreeable	pp=1.9895091011560335
i do not believe a word of it my dear	pp=3.60969244233632
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long	pp=4.243455985077559
but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs	pp=4.210409249032164
i do not mind his not talking to mrs	pp=3.7300861913704666
long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza	pp=3.2814510914958523
another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with _him_ if i were you	pp=3.8193993154837957
his pride said miss lucas does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it	pp=3.8471713816816253
if i may so express it he has a _right_ to be proud	pp=3.1184963122985923
that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive _his_ pride if he had not mortified _mine_	pp=4.1540039731039995
pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe	pp=3.4868970932458554
a person may be proud without being vain	pp=2.362368737877289
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us	pp=3.167516322519182
if i were as rich as mr	pp=2.671154750502795
i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day	pp=2.891107767759746
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs	pp=3.3531519552272386
bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly	pp=3.8474447348203036
the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit chapter vi	pp=3.7248453808882402
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield	pp=2.7661483753036964
the visit was returned in due form	pp=2.4031043995233587
hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest	pp=3.778029203461736
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration	pp=4.420643936442045
it was generally evident whenever they met that he _did_ admire her and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent	pp=4.312297137070167
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas	pp=2.1029781981481657
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded	pp=4.497503372682312
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark	pp=3.9672153895095867
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself	pp=3.982238368927986
we can all _begin_ freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement	pp=3.766924953264468
in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels	pp=3.0168309331748335
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on	pp=3.560923138897649
if _i_ can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too	pp=4.038040825203991
remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do	pp=3.5955374978231
but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out	pp=3.817112272966139
perhaps he must if he sees enough of her	pp=2.44223449868313
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention	pp=3.4480802368387815
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it	pp=4.162266292173329
but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design	pp=3.119235337621795
as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness	pp=3.4211325157068484
she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times	pp=3.8177036917454363
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character	pp=3.9449246833941802
had she merely _dined_ with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent togetherand four evenings may do a great deal	pp=3.788788505000155
well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth	pp=4.226471147284271
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance	pp=2.9397152044073063
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life	pp=3.9544529782399254
you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself	pp=4.401104057662756
occupied in observing mr	pp=1.3997544161935518
darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise	pp=4.490064340024209
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes	pp=4.192602963357472
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying	pp=2.3732019257035515
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness	pp=4.202880754937272
he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others	pp=3.768262539081513
his doing so drew her notice	pp=1.9684717589496412
it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled	pp=3.0579169103850794
what does mr	pp=2.2555353509701574
darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster	pp=3.0153790440312878
that is a question which mr	pp=1.8139712909222774
darcy only can answer	pp=1.4132865073861238
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about	pp=4.403671221180477
he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him	pp=4.405461105156138
on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said  did not you think mr	pp=4.2829372973294495
darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton	pp=3.678565606652637
with great energybut it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic	pp=3.6994136730864584
you are severe on us	pp=1.7241884852145744
it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas	pp=3.71501386854092
i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows	pp=2.9159726452373818
you are a very strange creature by way of a friendalways wanting me to play and sing before any body and every bodyif my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers	pp=4.4786137296129
on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must	pp=3.3368778014038396
and gravely glancing at mr	pp=1.7128358762720206
her performance was pleasing though by no means capital	pp=3.1970309431502475
after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display	pp=4.09867486652207
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached	pp=3.9622931977738745
elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room mr	pp=4.309183505778272
darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began	pp=3.977894211746999
what a charming amusement for young people this is mr	pp=2.598325109779616
certainly sirand it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the worldevery savage can dance	pp=3.2838116844752343
sir william only smiled	pp=1.4138211479777987
your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the groupand i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy	pp=3.6486714026369844
you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir	pp=2.4858881363005865
yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight	pp=2.5860425958601145
do you often dance at st jamess never sir	pp=2.5035995434843263
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	pp=3.9990384263001113
it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it	pp=3.8855069229256154
you have a house in town i conclude mr darcy bowed	pp=3.3874523133113787
i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myselffor i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas	pp=3.790319059767512
he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her  my dear miss eliza why are not you dancingmr	pp=4.1873483108267475
darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partneryou cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you	pp=4.211430397530079
and taking her hand he would have given it to mr	pp=3.6003514250251376
darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william  indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancingi entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner mr	pp=4.074790054273092
darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain	pp=3.3577052068155138
elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion	pp=3.2006154660425103
darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling	pp=2.1947939060215838
he is indeedbut considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner	pp=3.635882357397294
elizabeth looked archly and turned away	pp=1.9378322749462011
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley  i can guess the subject of your reverie	pp=4.379024666898749
i should imagine not	pp=1.3998563571707943
you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion	pp=3.8212551938566435
my mind was more agreeably engaged	pp=1.99398921904454
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	pp=4.121597095736989
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections mr	pp=3.652094923141058
darcy replied with great intrepidity  miss elizabeth bennet	pp=2.3668443708488787
miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley	pp=2.392390345917955
i am all astonishment	pp=1.413628960252373
how long has she been such a favouriteand pray when am i to wish you joy	pp=3.352926450984566
that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask	pp=3.1268008657583612
a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment	pp=3.096264350530098
i knew you would be wishing me joy	pp=2.5721974844983544
nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled	pp=3.571723600776553
you will have a charming motherinlaw indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you	pp=3.9216662662312127
he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long chapter vii mr	pp=4.0054279426411625
bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his	pp=3.8514445353206748
her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds	pp=3.0409990414790964
she had a sister married to a mr	pp=2.862250039891035
philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade	pp=4.094166691080534
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way	pp=3.9208110699059593
at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters	pp=3.8026648400477234
their visits to mrs	pp=1.4081653613553617
philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence	pp=3.0170411019507095
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections	pp=3.126549167936584
their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves mr	pp=3.7533840987485902
philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before	pp=3.3077832789892656
they could talk of nothing but officers and mr	pp=2.7193885123384196
bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign	pp=3.5852472982034533
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr	pp=3.046275492478264
bennet coolly observed  from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country	pp=3.9623315566575745
i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced	pp=3.5797289920946196
catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london	pp=4.342652330863009
bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly	pp=4.212421961052248
if i wished to think slightingly of any bodys children it should not be of my own however	pp=3.5238807805385806
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it	pp=3.390637239290804
yesbut as it happens they are all of them very clever	pp=3.2750524775145733
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish	pp=3.8496215584827214
my dear mr	pp=2.9555888401573216
bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and motherwhen they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do	pp=4.88277590206681
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals	pp=4.018746839392968
mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library mrs	pp=3.5660769229532487
bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer mrs	pp=3.0506255714819948
what is it about	pp=1.8545399385765426
what does he say	pp=1.1244277752224767
well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love	pp=2.8399736778160456
it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud	pp=3.101232814320747
my dear friend  if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days têteàtête between two women can never end without a quarrel	pp=4.254311601121217
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers	pp=3.003737359992321
yours ever  caroline bingley	pp=1.4115423638682076
with the officers cried lydia	pp=1.7370986345529051
i wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_	pp=2.7733744547516257
bennet that is very unlucky	pp=2.6228012594853465
can i have the carriage said jane	pp=2.7189110966074312
no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night	pp=4.034796723162672
oh but the gentlemen will have mr	pp=2.184116924911835
bingleys chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs	pp=3.369278143764952
i had much rather go in the coach	pp=2.3087137018836548
but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure	pp=3.1525967958133663
they are wanted in the farm mr	pp=1.6158304706712017
bennet are not they	pp=1.4069159143224377
they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them	pp=2.7146812652656718
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged	pp=3.240699069385992
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day	pp=4.055381080185694
her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard	pp=3.9219647904270682
her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted	pp=3.2135452394241715
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back	pp=2.9203179629166476
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs	pp=2.635129985346649
bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own	pp=3.534496772693857
till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance	pp=4.687323635351906
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better	pp=3.169947658636653
they insist also on my seeing mr	pp=2.1725513730060437
jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meand excepting a sorethroat and headache there is not much the matter with me yours c	pp=3.931758508343227
bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr	pp=4.51404585143944
bingley and under your orders	pp=1.7334231949397958
people do not die of little trifling colds	pp=2.3297560166344424
as long as she stays there it is all very well	pp=3.326082378320184
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative	pp=4.220366459194649
she declared her resolution	pp=1.4137551015552288
i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want	pp=3.138576940780201
i do not wish to avoid the walk	pp=5.16032495275457
i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required	pp=3.700339167830961
we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydiaelizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together	pp=3.4072437388430665
if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes	pp=3.5638556199623053
in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise	pp=4.177174838602038
she was shewn into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprisethat she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs	pp=3.788360183374698
hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it	pp=3.437439260762786
darcy said very little and mr	pp=1.9294688436702263
hurst nothing at all	pp=1.407905900858208
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone	pp=3.873904530403624
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast	pp=2.5242010018594403
miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room	pp=3.658152365625696
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance	pp=4.009628388193811
she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with	pp=3.6679275278982133
elizabeth silently attended her	pp=1.3839164831028965
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane	pp=3.5530228019482393
the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts	pp=4.137299313442769
the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely	pp=2.936914055843507
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere	pp=3.9532851917771774
when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so	pp=3.408144615307868
miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present	pp=4.2859485353750895
elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes chapter viii	pp=3.519006076826079
at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner	pp=3.2561080358059247
to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr	pp=3.937838922161181
bingleys she could not make a very favourable answer	pp=4.95522430788764
jane was by no means better	pp=2.6890538963695296
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike	pp=4.193357837048001
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency	pp=4.318198452861706
she had very little notice from any but him	pp=2.423486187565438
darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr	pp=3.1107264019017764
hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her	pp=3.60371621306049
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	pp=4.355582049137455
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty mrs	pp=4.137038254422319
hurst thought the same and added  she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker	pp=3.219807553333145
i shall never forget her appearance this morning	pp=2.445016582431443
she really looked almost wild	pp=1.7394117317337767
she did indeed louisa	pp=1.4140672949283655
very nonsensical to come at all why must _she_ be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold	pp=3.2779679166293496
her hair so untidy so blowsy  yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office	pp=3.933664982815765
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning	pp=3.5081615559688726
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice	pp=2.1959715519445395
_you_ observed it mr	pp=1.4009493193416958
darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition certainly not	pp=4.628357995004927
to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it	pp=3.4457077762354538
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley	pp=4.116555153696563
darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes	pp=3.4495406789180647
not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercisea short pause followed this speech and mrs	pp=3.4360785740354496
hurst began again	pp=1.5837349137692847
i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled	pp=3.8553242713444096
but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it	pp=4.393787507614097
i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton	pp=2.3176170495927657
yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside	pp=2.628497389956172
that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily	pp=3.2934272958842348
if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable	pp=3.6662928034157543
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy	pp=4.139157442614941
to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations	pp=3.7126489958411977
with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee	pp=3.547379580103442
on entering the drawingroom she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book mr	pp=4.029319414512225
hurst looked at her with astonishment	pp=2.490636450773468
do you prefer reading to cards	pp=1.9365540375361907
said he that is rather singular	pp=2.474389262165475
miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards	pp=2.5672510274989677
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else	pp=3.553658928240468
i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am _not_ a great reader and i have pleasure in many things	pp=3.6826812126254773
in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well	pp=4.084378802781656
elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying	pp=3.3147523040126825
he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded	pp=2.7299688800940705
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into	pp=4.453601851568086
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of bookswhat a delightful library you have at pemberley mr	pp=3.7825420532935925
darcy  it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations	pp=3.6181001364721848
and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books	pp=3.388658641256821
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these	pp=2.9883095946912137
neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place	pp=3.6451190683444805
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model	pp=3.6856853644131466
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire	pp=2.978022942162746
with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it	pp=2.9660936454625504
i am talking of possibilities charles	pp=1.9529473769731003
upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation	pp=3.6963935052626384
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the cardtable and stationed herself between mr	pp=3.9493930167823517
bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game	pp=2.971387898310488
is miss darcy much grown since the spring	pp=2.5352537131098094
said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am	pp=3.1249248650506094
i think she will	pp=1.1239139604190265
she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather taller	pp=2.723789577221608
how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much	pp=3.028639521491653
such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite	pp=3.209004849215059
yes all of them i think	pp=2.426222134679088
they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses	pp=2.4689392842490294
your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth	pp=3.046605150962054
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen	pp=3.384081741294129
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general	pp=3.913780342447597
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished	pp=3.7758078037726435
nor i i am sure said miss bingley	pp=2.3715839336533517
then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman	pp=3.6919083808603474
oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with	pp=3.3909546981663032
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved	pp=3.4293451553524057
all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading	pp=3.4281320903201435
i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women	pp=3.1553337589093804
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_	pp=2.5694412552571104
are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this	pp=3.518241372300011
_i_ never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united mrs	pp=3.308405711524546
hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward	pp=2.7077413289545462
as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room	pp=3.049953796285301
eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds	pp=4.237496182311358
but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art	pp=3.7016728427586787
undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation	pp=3.268499365791123
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable	pp=2.14427461679047
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject	pp=4.264956211291362
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her	pp=4.7954717339925
bingley urged mr	pp=1.570494428360955
joness being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians	pp=3.727639257818841
this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that mr	pp=4.690452857696771
jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better	pp=3.316003816552532
bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable	pp=3.292421334579289
they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister chapter ix	pp=3.7408941216363427
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr	pp=4.0812368208448015
in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation	pp=3.9925971843968386
the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with mrs	pp=2.9919648681874467
bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast	pp=3.1547858478483466
had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs	pp=2.481542609118624
bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield	pp=4.216487545150138
she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable	pp=4.097800614664293
after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour	pp=3.7153946811434886
bingley met them with hopes that mrs	pp=2.163938526972495
bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected	pp=2.800322337637431
indeed i have sir was her answer	pp=2.3682596335569865
she is a great deal too ill to be moved mr	pp=3.7775960497007874
jones says we must not think of moving her	pp=3.2947410785220472
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness	pp=2.7695095626734183
my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal	pp=3.8865381901700293
bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments	pp=1.938922639045932
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with	pp=4.586975526324225
you have a sweet room here mr	pp=2.5641886824929068
bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk	pp=2.496985554463522
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield	pp=3.771232439251593
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease	pp=4.2258854648434765
whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes	pp=3.5445803086298056
at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here	pp=2.977649852984814
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth	pp=3.5260971879981695
cried he turning towards her	pp=1.7148158711222645
oh yesi understand you perfectly	pp=1.7210033712516362
that is as it happens	pp=1.721997915548162
it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	pp=3.445756538541781
lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home	pp=4.013049689718244
i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character	pp=3.5153766836943605
it must be an amusing study	pp=3.1848361107061316
yes but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing	pp=2.32824519212189
they have at least that advantage	pp=2.3708614676537088
the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study	pp=3.3466798359714423
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society	pp=3.059252154573555
yes indeed cried mrs	pp=1.407917767550719
bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood	pp=2.6427475530129056
i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town	pp=3.1982195140892005
every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away mrs	pp=4.46908666116911
bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph	pp=3.0338892238100126
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places	pp=3.4446894381633557
when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same	pp=4.183802454576572
they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either	pp=3.128061396574168
but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all	pp=3.07792917656367
indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother	pp=3.032585136819031
you quite mistook mr darcy	pp=1.7228582364118392
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true	pp=3.570062219223358
certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger	pp=3.636161612277897
i know we dine with four and twenty families	pp=2.456458635033803
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance	pp=2.752200010425873
darcy with a very expressive smile	pp=2.5120265380823676
yes she called yesterday with her father	pp=2.1613904953948055
bingleyis not he	pp=1.5733136189154582
so much the man of fashion so genteel and so easyhe has always something to say to every body_that_ is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter	pp=3.7730292282536104
did charlotte dine with you	pp=1.7075542424369712
no she would go home	pp=1.738802071521995
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies	pp=2.4612075162014144
for my part mr	pp=1.814603897784601
but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you	pp=3.5032123969482507
it is a pity they are not handsome not that _i_ think charlotte so _very_ plainbut then she is our particular friend	pp=3.9692664332065415
she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley	pp=2.706329878695284
oh dear yesbut you must own she is very plain	pp=2.9747837227297933
lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me janes beauty	pp=2.7694653310401565
i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see any body better looking	pp=5.037684985357839
it is what every body says	pp=2.2344297700921367
i do not trust my own partiality	pp=3.7979489581495987
when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away	pp=4.284355197844993
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently	pp=2.3496658663137837
there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way	pp=3.678362698498142
of a fine stout healthy love it may	pp=2.3558057012376903
every thing nourishes what is strong already	pp=2.191036851435656
but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away	pp=3.4321179329051037
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again	pp=3.163309169913021
she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs	pp=4.248424642990898
bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy mr	pp=3.690522598451075
bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required	pp=3.175456830105997
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs	pp=2.61286030260559
bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage	pp=2.7760046669713763
upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward	pp=2.632447761097674
bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield	pp=3.44109056549432
lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age	pp=3.592202935347383
she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance	pp=3.8730299817577754
she was very equal therefore to address mr	pp=2.888790593831407
bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it	pp=4.531426964587841
i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball	pp=3.8550644527906632
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill	pp=2.754532775746201
lydia declared herself satisfied	pp=1.4136662983136143
oh yesit would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again	pp=3.5763705786540725
and when you have given _your_ ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also	pp=3.2117447616384203
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not mrs	pp=4.046614686779327
darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on _fine eyes_ chapter x	pp=4.3774489201058415
the day passed much as the day before had done mrs	pp=3.5977405081341316
hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawingroom	pp=4.079043576191716
the loo table however did not appear mr	pp=3.070251717381641
hurst and mr	pp=3.2974264207715858
bingley were at piquet and mrs	pp=1.9343466884620024
hurst was observing their game	pp=1.7339747159588854
elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion	pp=3.200411566696081
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each	pp=3.891179154330629
how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter  he made no answer	pp=2.915676075869009
you write uncommonly fast	pp=1.4140031288162695
you are mistaken	pp=2.44621447882169
i write rather slowly	pp=1.4140890549787235
how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year letters of business too how odious i should think them  it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours	pp=3.7091035518241933
pray tell your sister that i long to see her	pp=2.327248515484761
i have already told her so once by your desire	pp=2.7768242699926375
i am afraid you do not like your pen	pp=4.285239283465869
let me mend it for you	pp=1.943240361064099
how can you contrive to write so even	pp=3.0043258316607964
he was silent	pp=4.636284941250645
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys	pp=4.2252518708752635
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write againat present i have not room to do them justice	pp=4.000122443010634
oh it is of no consequence	pp=2.3352933655588997
i shall see her in january	pp=2.1605562562490133
but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy	pp=2.9842402212166994
they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine	pp=4.040743923544968
that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brotherbecause he does _not_ write with ease	pp=3.379411344378464
he studies too much for words of four syllablesdo not you darcy	pp=3.1448921581836706
my style of writing is very different from yours	pp=2.694965435408978
oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable	pp=3.1648934881643864
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents	pp=4.114951851123602
your humility mr	pp=1.5728632561910234
bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof	pp=1.995943499752843
nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility	pp=3.2254675860242865
it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast	pp=2.747247335623202
and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty	pp=3.198360025412856
the indirect boastfor you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting	pp=3.5900008638988603
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance	pp=3.670176018523039
when you told mrs	pp=1.6668169893266893
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else	pp=4.143192840508941
nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning	pp=3.6074450239574016
at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	pp=3.7296795780630894
i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity	pp=4.9586571862616795
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not goand at another word might stay a month	pp=3.936097764183594
you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr	pp=2.5912246185820904
bingley did not do justice to his own disposition	pp=3.3604306569539752
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself	pp=3.227853011053574
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper	pp=3.3097859951860866
darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it	pp=3.0679697461655486
upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself	pp=3.250674495023619
you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged	pp=4.013592768567641
to yield readilyeasilyto the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you	pp=2.9216997850321436
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either	pp=2.871908513505555
you appear to me mr	pp=1.9651324147017573
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it	pp=3.225258679107042
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley	pp=4.364307856524846
we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon	pp=3.2616551718771105
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it	pp=3.906959901521634
by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of	pp=3.705706613913561
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do mr	pp=3.7741754119247175
darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh	pp=3.7409505571091066
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense	pp=3.3892059470565616
i see your design bingley said his friendyou dislike an argument and want to silence this	pp=3.0001897164849836
arguments are too much like disputes	pp=2.238045918262978
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me	pp=4.033869211259057
what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr	pp=2.9801254785318108
darcy had much better finish his letter mr	pp=2.560733884427941
darcy took her advice and did finish his letter	pp=2.649199969213373
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music	pp=3.8783774702032487
hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr	pp=4.399565813439486
darcys eyes were fixed on her	pp=1.4681299295488228
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange	pp=4.479161159892269
she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present	pp=3.9881715761177214
the supposition did not pain her	pp=1.9576162965369723
she liked him too little to care for his approbation	pp=2.734414970586615
after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr	pp=3.2977533694884333
darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her  do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel	pp=4.039400081778809
she smiled but made no answer	pp=1.990736605562453
he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence	pp=2.5887083052234647
you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt	pp=4.000817468876883
indeed i do not dare	pp=3.72286669658625
elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her	pp=4.377895845485352
he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger	pp=3.5981037860451464
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	pp=3.4390021279068144
i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officersand if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses	pp=4.355102243834691
oh yesdo let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley	pp=3.797693277535526
put them next to your great uncle the judge	pp=2.425988768928905
they are in the same profession you know only in different lines	pp=3.308360805303361
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs	pp=3.5741370728836785
hurst and elizabeth herself	pp=1.4103725691334579
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard	pp=4.528332415817499
you used us abominably ill answered mrs	pp=2.2001287098235136
then taking the disengaged arm of mr	pp=2.142878572715063
darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself	pp=2.3085527003115796
the path just admitted three mr	pp=1.984654837111619
darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said  this walk is not wide enough for our party	pp=3.014950854593236
we had better go into the avenue	pp=2.6345494366887356
but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered  no no stay where you areyou are charmingly groupd and appear to uncommon advantage	pp=3.783396968624505
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye	pp=2.6971489558916613
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening chapter xi	pp=3.003129587323804
when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	pp=4.919713968345277
their powers of conversation were considerable	pp=1.9907647133161863
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit	pp=3.371404903924179
miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps	pp=3.876169228766599
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr	pp=3.5196254575186177
hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation	pp=3.649344310343247
he was full of joy and attention	pp=2.1066926490879934
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be farther from the door	pp=3.8847656273851103
he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else	pp=3.3263291749555535
elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight	pp=2.979011027598904
when tea was over mr	pp=1.7677327116371202
hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the cardtablebut in vain	pp=2.406092635192292
she had obtained private intelligence that mr	pp=2.1729625351921444
she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her mr	pp=4.11226561661956
hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennet	pp=3.331935483915871
miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr	pp=2.7838741611310582
darcys progress through _his_ book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page	pp=3.808374493583837
at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a bookwhen i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library	pp=4.661903828581434
no one made any reply	pp=1.7337436138781044
she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said  by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfieldi would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure	pp=4.070127839176212
i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting	pp=4.141443080055189
much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball	pp=3.7640186970721086
miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room	pp=3.425227078081528
her figure was elegant and she walked wellbut darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious	pp=3.660046810317942
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said  miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the roomi assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude	pp=3.9530133992689023
elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately	pp=2.360700903503561
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr	pp=3.199897660472822
darcy looked up	pp=2.502237327311565
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book	pp=3.4513570376293528
he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere	pp=3.716864288805689
what could he mean	pp=1.4136912304644977
she was dying to know what could be his meaningand asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him	pp=3.349463548331029
not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it	pp=3.774266319006615
miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr	pp=2.524364889788186
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak	pp=4.434719394075533
you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walkingif the first i should be completely in your wayand if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire	pp=3.935854567694355
oh shocking cried miss bingley	pp=1.735710976822342
nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth	pp=2.8094579978994147
we can all plague and punish one another	pp=2.5288889432209447

but upon my honour i do _not_	pp=2.1969996020805436
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_	pp=2.8674123981802624

i dearly love a laugh	pp=1.7144186597088344
the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke	pp=3.7808581037431357
certainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope i am not one of _them_	pp=4.247595766518407
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good	pp=2.7997245050119837
perhaps that is not possible for any one	pp=2.8615777325002805
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule	pp=3.491586900444083
yes vanity is a weakness indeed	pp=1.9740504447610223
but pridewhere there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation	pp=3.4396722659538765
darcy is over i presume said miss bingleyand pray what is the result	pp=3.2932620526158427
i am perfectly convinced by it that mr	pp=2.8338567138583706
he owns it himself without disguise	pp=1.9937659799274583
nosaid darcy i have made no such pretension	pp=2.297393480821895
i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding	pp=2.958448197627687
my temper i dare not vouch forit is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world	pp=3.3192071965967145
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself	pp=3.541255419567276
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them	pp=2.7145259586075006
_that_ is a failing indeedcried elizabeth	pp=1.9919037972314386
implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character	pp=2.300442367112372
you are safe from me	pp=1.7235067566741131
and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body	pp=2.556378296666884
and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them	pp=2.7695440636619053
do let us have a little musiccried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no sharelouisa you will not mind my waking mr hurst	pp=4.592178347771815
her sister made not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it	pp=3.668865976788826
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day but mrs	pp=4.143588834276586
bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before	pp=3.6800539523897315
her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home mrs	pp=3.3124267585829488
bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made	pp=3.5145659926842265
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred	pp=3.869780561478275
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other	pp=3.981321161514576
darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at netherfield long enough	pp=3.19119925982032
she attracted him more than he likedand miss bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teazing than usual to himself	pp=3.879446923477476
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it	pp=3.979766621413252
steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her	pp=4.3129447148573306
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place	pp=2.881663541952552
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother mrs	pp=2.9979686402802863
bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold againbut their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle	pp=3.9370996278289465
the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth	pp=3.709432719164508
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to	pp=3.4053873535620656
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort	pp=2.96133857383482
i hope my dear said mr	pp=2.452111803832837
bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party	pp=4.688616117358011
who do you mean my dear	pp=2.364377811972585
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her	pp=4.617376297794851
i do not believe she often sees such at home	pp=3.3115855630452304
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger mrs	pp=3.293719174164001
bennets eyes sparkleda gentleman and a stranger it is mr	pp=2.475564342328401
bingley i am sure	pp=1.1246183169128967
why janeyou never dropt a word of this you sly thing well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr	pp=4.341606015512498
bingleybutgood lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got today	pp=2.998997810169218
lydia my love ring the bell	pp=1.9477054759018342
i must speak to hill this moment	pp=2.3309328874532196
it is _not_ mr	pp=1.3981588283151638
bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life	pp=4.089786573013899
this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	pp=3.565183222974839
about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention	pp=3.686054592897504
it is from my cousin mr	pp=2.2093696041448965
collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases	pp=4.038967292667312
pray do not talk of that odious man	pp=2.741865379125468
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it	pp=4.886816033913909
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail	pp=3.941304880879868
bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	pp=4.012299409718746
bennet and nothing can clear mr	pp=1.9821687529368783
collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn	pp=2.1533356709131164
but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself	pp=3.9806360081712095
no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical	pp=4.637397181391585
i hate such false friends	pp=1.739659828784636
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him	pp=2.989737915811843
why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear	pp=3.4668216191586763
_hunsford near westerham kent  <NUM>th october_  dear sir  the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variancethere mrs	pp=4.267920998921846
bennetmy mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england	pp=4.093152475964571
as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of goodwill are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch	pp=4.163062806593265
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amendsbut of this hereafter	pp=4.237073234137442
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november <NUM>th by four oclock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday senight following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day	pp=3.9951559112564636
i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your wellwisher and friend  william collins	pp=3.185803018860469
at four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman said mr	pp=2.8025931663245807
bennet as he folded up the letter	pp=2.159153268063579
he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again	pp=4.059960206252059
there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him	pp=4.388306262308575
though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit	pp=3.584833310047893
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required	pp=3.6601422512859534
he must be an oddity i think said she	pp=3.2885294817165
i cannot make him outthere is something very pompous in his styleand what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entailwe cannot suppose he would help it if he couldcan he be a sensible man sir	pp=3.49143042624068
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse	pp=2.54823465641564
i am impatient to see him	pp=2.1625933632050325
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed	pp=4.207184833706357
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting	pp=3.387945158440348
as for their mother mr	pp=1.7262980689928242
collinss letter had done away much of her illwill and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters mr	pp=4.28071996789949
collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family mr	pp=3.6488363207550196
bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr	pp=3.5711857693581632
collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself	pp=2.958904254938136
he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty	pp=3.805862572768082
his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal	pp=3.23254725954131
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs	pp=3.3447232191779452
bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	pp=3.8627865188800676
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs	pp=3.3926765178879883
you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate	pp=2.7873722547479636
ah sir i do indeed	pp=1.7368874737386213
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess	pp=3.68516963511284
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed	pp=3.6751724166823454
i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousinsand could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate	pp=4.131786756580918
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them	pp=3.6157047970356695
at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted  he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other	pp=3.9548020618845476
they were not the only objects of mr collinss admiration	pp=2.982138521300255
bennets heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property	pp=3.2245953940331447
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing	pp=3.3293995525622315
but here he was set right by mrs	pp=2.3424345178730297
he begged pardon for having displeased her	pp=2.155813486352404
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour chapter xiv	pp=3.569890606868197
during dinner mr	pp=2.227892095142696
bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness	pp=4.059404094467844
lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable mr	pp=3.4880695130461663
bennet could not have chosen better mr	pp=3.543803435265168
collins was eloquent in her praise	pp=1.9385996858464412
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine	pp=4.9835780509559795
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her	pp=4.171947453999142
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening	pp=3.5277940211370122
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations	pp=3.9859650395528443
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closets up stairs	pp=4.163256687072403
that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs	pp=4.060544370953064
bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman	pp=3.634785600670518
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her	pp=3.4635091290109736
does she live near you sir	pp=1.9799288763009084
the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyships residence	pp=3.537017308104425
i think you said she was a widow sir	pp=3.2149777202094896
has she any family	pp=1.412413406061297
she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property	pp=2.831981484283392
ah cried mrs	pp=1.581581740518274
bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls	pp=2.963239826040259
and what sort of young lady is she	pp=2.5521096005921775
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them	pp=3.9607033316786002
but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies	pp=3.5151996050968366
has she been presented	pp=1.6816431263172003
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court	pp=3.776938469069351
her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament	pp=3.7901124967288027
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies	pp=4.502611829794322
i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by herthese are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay	pp=4.718501248537702
you judge very properly said mr	pp=1.9790240226199811
bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy	pp=3.3691466478269922
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study	pp=3.711062064144173
bennets expectations were fully answered	pp=1.7402718516231812
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure	pp=3.9672038454367207
by teatime however the dose had been enough and mr	pp=2.5339771453133526
bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies mr	pp=3.671916015199484
collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novelskitty stared at him and lydia exclaimedother books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyces sermons	pp=3.9620656897092754
lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with  do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him	pp=4.157842857804924
i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr	pp=3.1987633225902963
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr	pp=3.0439837055596235
it amazes me i confessfor certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction	pp=3.4634257154401653
but i will no longer importune my young cousin	pp=2.978901215372792
then turning to mr	pp=1.4010052086587463
bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon mr	pp=2.584606068748246
bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements mrs	pp=3.494662048412111
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr	pp=3.85066576459293
collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr	pp=3.462116324732099
collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance	pp=4.308125803795998
the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity	pp=4.149846961046562
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humility	pp=4.141660731234923
this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part	pp=3.568338004904177
his plan did not vary on seeing themmiss bennets lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice	pp=3.8676005235351294
the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hours têteàtête with mrs	pp=3.4300607625528863
bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed onas to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to sayshe could not positively answerbut she did not _know_ of any prepossessionher _eldest_ daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged mr	pp=4.182057375993136
bennet was stirring the fire	pp=1.679806620103476
elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course mrs	pp=2.82441112072193
bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces	pp=4.532380738066415
lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr	pp=3.5050472353125954
collins was to attend them at the request of mr	pp=2.7423941241676792
collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr	pp=3.8757698182492644
bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford	pp=2.811834851047632
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr	pp=4.019749793324027
collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr	pp=2.7244357903602205
collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go	pp=3.339812341464078
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_	pp=3.4275138395090456
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way	pp=4.104181666631834
the officer was the very mr	pp=1.9356686807454104
denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed	pp=3.122744591736498
denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr	pp=2.72764825896986
this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming	pp=4.001934516405718
his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address	pp=3.464726987674937
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street	pp=3.8915206986142246
on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities	pp=3.5806288105017403
bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object	pp=3.1773335059810948
he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her mr	pp=3.4123904533309233
darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting	pp=4.136433358959736
wickham after a few moments touched his hata salutation which mr	pp=3.3910900228962984
darcy just deigned to return	pp=1.6800128644965397
bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend mr	pp=2.9031141273485654
wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr	pp=3.699980113627668
philips throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation mrs	pp=2.7082217228191365
joness shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr	pp=4.396284853596755
collins by janes introduction of him	pp=1.932520055989062
she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice mrs	pp=4.232907093873236
philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr	pp=3.7145873415826833
denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the shire	pp=4.544515528156135
she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr	pp=3.6494117375477098
wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows	pp=3.886271862099894
wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening	pp=3.280343640645214
this was agreed to and mrs	pp=2.091869754123653
philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards	pp=3.6896731547169046
the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits mr	pp=3.575596580590687
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless	pp=3.9153666670708795
as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister mr	pp=4.497923240511594
collins on his return highly gratified mrs	pp=2.4288045109640053
bennet by admiring mrs	pp=1.40685293334987
philipss manners and politeness	pp=1.4138969114229658
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life chapter xvi	pp=3.979263656702669
as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr	pp=3.3701960652499814
bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroom that mr	pp=4.0363461926250075
wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house	pp=2.7150355218256035
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr	pp=2.9764930067253346
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs	pp=4.103582433189668
philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and found that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room	pp=4.142619799981712
to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantlepiece the interval of waiting appeared very long	pp=4.071822950737631
the gentlemen did approach and when mr	pp=2.3618076025639327
wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration	pp=3.913178290620233
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but mr	pp=3.7416343621927433
wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as _they_ were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room mr	pp=3.6892539036776197
wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker	pp=4.282076908093731
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr	pp=2.9218478601377993
wickham and the officers mr	pp=1.9650104342455663
collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs	pp=3.590082052897671
philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	pp=2.827016467165538
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist	pp=3.2091586421757667
at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular	pp=3.920155725023961
allowing for the common demands of the game mr	pp=2.615297396847308
wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy	pp=5.10369140120853
she dared not even mention that gentleman	pp=2.8107458856876444
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved mr	pp=2.174767888323867
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long mr	pp=3.194816620251612
darcy had been staying there	pp=2.2884333918472044
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand	pp=4.056605467551889
yes replied wickhamhis estate there is a noble one	pp=2.899277880644046
a clear ten thousand per annum	pp=1.9993392484600665
elizabeth could not but look surprised	pp=2.865418556008844
you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterdayare you much acquainted with mr darcy	pp=3.4932491317544696
as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmlyi have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable	pp=4.8368488129813265
i have no right to give _my_ opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise	pp=3.5992579300391676
i am not qualified to form one	pp=3.3175350663973555
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge	pp=3.946114398177965
upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield	pp=3.770637577747503
every body is disgusted with his pride	pp=2.3979056676822177
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one	pp=3.4162512670404603
i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen	pp=4.204224104011093
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen	pp=3.350916695209673
wickham only shook his head	pp=1.7232638150815813
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer	pp=4.276873001268264
i do not at all know but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield	pp=3.864639468149792
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood	pp=4.13322410175089
oh noit is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr darcy	pp=2.973538196907671
if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go	pp=2.5749769039662493
we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is	pp=3.995996119577544
his father miss bennet the late mr	pp=2.379932079591323
darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr	pp=4.432997527000193
darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections	pp=2.7262864863216105
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father	pp=3.915006424137362
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry mr	pp=3.5804555560122417
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire	pp=3.8256633236583273
i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them	pp=4.0115996443747255
i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude	pp=3.662989167328339
i _must_ have employment and society	pp=1.94194001866412
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible	pp=3.0623102884120583
the church _ought_ to have been my professioni was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now	pp=4.388984524342495
indeed  yesthe late mr	pp=1.3993280356747442
darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift	pp=2.9251435711410907
he was my godfather and excessively attached to me	pp=2.4202612999806004
i cannot do justice to his kindness	pp=2.0940547665763978
he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere	pp=4.167352907237535
good heavens cried elizabeth but how could _that_ behow could his will be disregardedwhy did not you seek legal redress	pp=3.4315232990565354
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law	pp=3.5616829273867254
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr	pp=3.9431229847596474
darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing	pp=3.848083556597844
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it	pp=4.120684253492218
i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him and _to_ him too freely	pp=3.549506585033831
but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me	pp=3.598705319760037
this is quite shockinghe deserves to be publicly disgraced	pp=2.4587882539788875
some time or other he _will_ bebut it shall not be by _me_	pp=3.2209453424533883
till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose _him_	pp=3.0250516451531566
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them	pp=3.002853377036577
a thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy	pp=3.2753202573634734
had the late mr	pp=1.4035832467624563
darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life	pp=3.431171769657226
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of preference which was often given me	pp=3.862198459180457
i had not thought mr	pp=2.3016499825808925
darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of himi had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this  after a few minutes reflection however she continued i _do_ remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper	pp=4.277457251838527
his disposition must be dreadful	pp=1.9891828361134662
i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham _i_ can hardly be just to him	pp=4.162582387878689
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his fathershe could have added a young man too like _you_ whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiablebut she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner  we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care	pp=4.159529373415999
darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property	pp=2.8926578949608466
he was most highly esteemed by mr	pp=2.1808848385120063
darcy a most intimate confidential friend mr	pp=2.1930940975335154
darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendance and when immediately before my fathers death mr	pp=3.21469948504979
darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself	pp=3.731643152208045
how abominablei wonder that the very pride of this mr	pp=2.5266191241420244
darcy has not made him just to youif from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor dishonesty i must call it	pp=4.136116364796001
it _is_ wonderfulreplied wickhamfor almost all his actions may be traced to prideand pride has often been his best friend	pp=3.2953329038380175
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling	pp=3.0659313845011797
can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good yes	pp=2.7840883216164833
it has often led him to be liberal and generousto give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor	pp=3.6429488930410265
family pride and _filial_ pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this	pp=3.676258528404925
not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive	pp=3.570947317497154
he has also _brotherly_ pride which with _some_ brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers	pp=4.1492815337385975
he shook his headi wish i could call her amiable	pp=3.191237675582889
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy	pp=2.9974903433082685
but she is too much like her brothervery very proudas a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement	pp=4.193048735326396
she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished	pp=3.604688566651524
since her fathers death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education	pp=3.3006931255685843
bingley how can mr	pp=1.4037120031603871
bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man	pp=3.6470152040933588
how can they suit each otherdo you know mr bingley	pp=2.609587895560909
not at all	pp=1.1241763237345632
he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man	pp=3.124919421197064
he cannot know what mr darcy is	pp=2.3987802830969476
probably notbut mr	pp=1.570494428360955
darcy can please where he chuses	pp=1.9811871278701008
he does not want abilities	pp=2.6302719327823945
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while	pp=2.9865571293666084
among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous	pp=4.2664869325298795
his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberalminded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing something for fortune and figure	pp=3.3530862349380244
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr	pp=3.1186206874472195
it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs	pp=3.2811924002002857
philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy	pp=4.490963025724947
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these thingsand happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object	pp=4.243313294717073
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters mr	pp=3.887428972497067
wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr	pp=2.520278876562474
collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh	pp=3.41039662776041
lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living	pp=3.171975333355741
i hardly know how mr	pp=2.0403677138231764
collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long	pp=3.2032558875928476
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy	pp=3.7190441157187575
no indeed i did noti knew nothing at all of lady catherines connections	pp=3.4953928451827068
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday	pp=3.6164651229552587
her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates	pp=4.334411479819879
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley	pp=3.3157635344509826
vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already selfdestined to another mr	pp=3.878136565539112
collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman	pp=4.01508933186602
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class	pp=3.722610762805858
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickhams attentions	pp=4.349641244452073
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs	pp=2.6472974211695104
philipss supper party but his manners recommended him to every body	pp=3.2219901224717864
whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully	pp=2.755965912181421
she could think of nothing but of mr	pp=2.1158994454862854
wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr	pp=4.393518233026845
collins were once silent	pp=1.4136178492394609
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr	pp=3.2193806984457725
collins in describing the civility of mr and mrs	pp=2.1535083069862595

wickham and herself	pp=2.455865664279346
jane listened with astonishment and concernshe knew not how to believe that mr	pp=3.0577220932319302
darcy could be so unworthy of mr	pp=2.4980415060514614
bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickhamthe possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained	pp=4.215651767953974
they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea	pp=3.8600410756567487
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other	pp=2.433715506039476
very true indeedand now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the businessdo clear _them_ too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody	pp=4.240054508804635
laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion	pp=4.010703121219157

darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a mannerone whom his father had promised to provide forit is impossible	pp=3.74699395406327
no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it	pp=3.367657214247548
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no	pp=2.8546213115271577
i can much more easily believe mr	pp=2.188715131796439
bingleys being imposed on than that mr	pp=2.1572361187105615
wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremonyif it be not so let mr	pp=3.520050512869296
darcy contradict it	pp=1.559099110516499
besides there was truth in his looks	pp=2.1627812379348046
it is difficult indeedit is distressingone does not know what to think	pp=3.2827212375696098
i beg your pardonone knows exactly what to think	pp=2.961468222045678
but jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat mr	pp=2.875495023382218
bingley if he _had been_ imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public	pp=3.1823433241911223
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr	pp=4.349157614500403
bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday	pp=3.483654816533658
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation	pp=4.262142583078226
to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs	pp=3.1547801250882848
they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities	pp=3.5641284782542972
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family mrs	pp=3.477012605056628
bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card	pp=2.1467367623925497
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr	pp=3.972250186332038
darcys looks and behaviour	pp=1.4132756253654144
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr	pp=3.714371333897039
wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball	pp=3.5976453183423396
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it	pp=3.611739882940655
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enoughi think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	pp=3.3990059111252866
society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body	pp=3.4994994540370903
elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr	pp=3.7904045824182897
collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr	pp=3.5850554110354707
bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance	pp=4.322739404755544
i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especiallya preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her	pp=4.35442891328667
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dancesand to have mr	pp=2.9550881542368783
collins instead her liveliness had been never worse timed	pp=2.5011281666025846
there was no help for it however mr	pp=3.475502524732144
wickhams happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and mr	pp=3.4369792929526675
collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could	pp=3.0217760081096423
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something moreit now first struck her that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors	pp=3.968366960315437
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_	pp=4.082516073482046
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply mr	pp=3.714715049092127
collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him	pp=3.2506509538101374
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once	pp=4.499665315865752
no aunt no officers no news could be sought afterthe very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy	pp=3.1334564665688007
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr	pp=3.2540142652098005
wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia chapter xviii	pp=3.578372558214042
till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in vain for mr	pp=3.186723068261574
wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	pp=3.9424355274381133
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her	pp=4.1649315055322464
she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening	pp=4.034010925210095
denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile  i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here	pp=4.584769207270885
this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to makeattention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham	pp=4.056873619888566
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr	pp=4.161108925745628
bingley whose blind partiality provoked her	pp=1.965575316160209
but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice	pp=4.632812150771587
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked	pp=4.162688232013815
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr	pp=3.9473428742942254
darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him	pp=3.586481441479806
he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her	pp=4.008685961415337
i dare say you will find him very agreeable	pp=3.5540939882853744
heaven forbid_that_ would be the greatest misfortune of allto find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hatedo not wish me such an evil	pp=3.5727907526705187
when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence	pp=4.707331535996775
elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr	pp=3.7294115652739
darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it	pp=2.82142543911936
they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance	pp=3.8616415808947395
he replied and was again silent	pp=1.9769861755173257
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with  it is _your_ turn to say something now mr	pp=3.5488649050832866
darcy_i_ talked about the dance and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples	pp=3.552486024143513
he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said	pp=3.5751018069023397
very wellthat reply will do for the presentperhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public onesbut _now_ we may be silent	pp=3.364567578813568
do you talk by rule then while you are dancing sometimes	pp=2.7102814448527868
one must speak a little you know	pp=2.1648144968781216
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of _some_ conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible	pp=4.198503130869197
are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine	pp=3.734725252354949
both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our mindswe are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb	pp=4.017172662441724
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he	pp=3.74708421585714
i must not decide on my own performance	pp=2.5696790496324726
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton	pp=3.8284327824155358
she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance	pp=3.803638668338453
the effect was immediate	pp=1.4138811185850721
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on	pp=3.593362310116595
at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said  mr	pp=3.197181993350648
wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friendswhether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them is less certain	pp=3.4877810447542203
he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life	pp=4.2669757615641535
darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject	pp=2.6576622101655176
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr	pp=3.714415876602103
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner	pp=3.3038355523782226
such very superior dancing is not often seen	pp=2.355656048835793
it is evident that you belong to the first circles	pp=2.6934662877830307
allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place	pp=4.072444776221356
what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr	pp=2.536062022294776
darcybut let me not interrupt you siryou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me	pp=3.543454032863635
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together	pp=4.194018474063459
recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said  sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	pp=3.376228332737501
i do not think we were speaking at all	pp=3.4525924226260556
what think you of books	pp=1.6557095890607982
booksoh noi am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings	pp=3.3135830853648103
i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subjectwe may compare our different opinions	pp=4.067757288539299
noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full of something else	pp=3.1130537008877877
the _present_ always occupies you in such scenesdoes it	pp=2.454873140554873
said he with a look of doubt	pp=2.2113028847154244
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr	pp=3.6467134288786913
darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable	pp=2.8639099755990634
you are very cautious i suppose as to its _being created_	pp=3.0279063779281317
i am said he with a firm voice	pp=2.2833770432611233
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice	pp=2.4514196266863917
i hope not	pp=3.236327825427361
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first	pp=3.130042627650856
may i ask to what these questions tend	pp=2.4787088713791494
merely to the illustration of _your_ character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity	pp=2.928145599867924
i am trying to make it out	pp=2.0730373224591663
and what is your success	pp=2.8318244264186108
she shook her head	pp=1.4139343523733128
i do not get on at all	pp=3.740224331230378
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly	pp=2.8468754972635524
i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either	pp=4.385303585016915
but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity	pp=3.9011212025797284
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied	pp=3.6262796398361226
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another	pp=3.9163344191122262
let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr	pp=3.413678343475766
darcy in a most infamous manner	pp=2.511608260471178
darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way	pp=4.374655201691425
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it	pp=3.4034484263122087
i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better	pp=3.37036329214706
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr	pp=4.229011966864978
darcys steward and of _that_ i can assure you he informed me himself	pp=2.8679382158991444
i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer	pp=2.990744645487292
excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant	pp=1.9742446580304986
insolent girl said elizabeth to herselfyou are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this	pp=3.368727795716262
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy	pp=3.0732116801004397
she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley	pp=3.2953721296895266
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the eveningelizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness	pp=4.310476408008465
i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about mr wickham	pp=4.067554054387175
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon	pp=4.3926134032936135
no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr	pp=4.267466206205509
bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr	pp=3.832299341386389
darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr	pp=3.331131931801163
wickham has deserved much less attention from mr	pp=2.350647110131889
wickham is by no means a respectable young man	pp=2.8371322391372877
i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys regard mr	pp=3.4098066111217005
bingley does not know mr wickham himself	pp=2.6280289358396516
no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton	pp=2.6802944136416307
this account then is what he has received from mr darcy	pp=3.0572965833154866
i am perfectly satisfied	pp=1.4136853398238296
but what does he say of the living	pp=2.0360478485117826
he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr	pp=3.3619619785169332
darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only	pp=4.193256867867807
i have not a doubt of mr	pp=2.4694742511498657
bingleys defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before	pp=4.469820642311543
bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr	pp=3.481218421178298
collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery	pp=4.539538132532363
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness	pp=3.6492782953105944
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine	pp=4.367233258900906
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology	pp=2.551991721534817
you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy	pp=3.2660645698403026
indeed i am	pp=1.525643397233853
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier	pp=2.854640901329659
i believe him to be lady catherines _nephew_	pp=3.401112560872709
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday senight	pp=3.570500698544797
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr	pp=3.31819480684243
darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr	pp=4.010487841179268
collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus  my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained	pp=4.071034158328717
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty	pp=3.942226535162748
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself	pp=3.8011261506879013
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr	pp=3.4186096630344416
darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident	pp=3.2253044650164817
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourghit vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man mr	pp=4.683654131287955
darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr	pp=2.7798032326200097
collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr	pp=2.566373359931805
darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr	pp=3.719623807903953
collins then returned to elizabeth	pp=1.6771660870224954
darcy seemed much pleased with the attention	pp=2.84854371704185
it was really a very handsome thought	pp=3.190043794586975
upon the whole i am much pleased with him	pp=3.450472365839217
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr	pp=3.9640942847514244
bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane	pp=3.5205685230187718
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters	pp=3.8012462756180763
her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much	pp=3.3632409884808054
when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr	pp=4.246417321199378
bingleyit was an animating subject and mrs	pp=2.1514432267940036
bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match	pp=2.9021114530513255
his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	pp=4.299689683930384
it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	pp=4.2524650052382995
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs	pp=3.8862472151481757
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life	pp=3.2523391062489186
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it	pp=3.635486442423644
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr	pp=3.83815225044248
darcy who sat opposite to them	pp=1.9354240533456937
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical	pp=2.3302175089805264
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear	pp=4.739723312521654
for heavens sake madam speak lowerwhat advantage can it be to you to offend mr	pp=2.931438431313973
darcyyou will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing	pp=2.9331720329678674
nothing that she could say however had any influence	pp=3.3599998614935944
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation	pp=2.4519040826457883
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr	pp=3.520246194245613
darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her	pp=4.081167125732637
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity	pp=3.1836447803633097
at length however mrs	pp=2.080406183255636
bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	pp=3.9981173131135783
elizabeth now began to revive	pp=1.68345641347657
but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company	pp=3.9255988689748995
by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisancebut in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song	pp=3.9649231141952757
elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another	pp=3.834668610609096
marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affectedelizabeth was in agonies	pp=3.952651788461123
she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley	pp=3.4831051543741784
she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave	pp=3.6871229215773123
she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night	pp=3.9516815070842966
he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud  that will do extremely well child	pp=3.25138853877221
you have delighted us long enough	pp=1.993752243764989
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit	pp=2.6590077984546974
mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no goodothers of the party were now applied to	pp=3.7742604270012814
if i said mr	pp=1.402263426855579
collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergymani do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to	pp=4.219595762748784
the rector of a parish has much to doin the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron	pp=3.952840597550007
he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible	pp=3.78763946003895
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment	pp=4.222835108872522
i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family	pp=3.768322843386187
and with a bow to mr	pp=3.133176848410739
darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the roommany staredmany smiled but no one looked more amused than mr	pp=4.035910388805042
bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr	pp=2.348102535434482
collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man	pp=3.5522707000818174
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed	pp=4.491421480339862
that his two sisters and mr	pp=2.100446575091683
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement	pp=2.660155648962681
collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others	pp=4.073135929612384
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room	pp=3.64407637238422
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening	pp=4.555450295132342
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and goodnaturedly engaged mr	pp=3.0842046738620246
collinss conversation to herself	pp=1.4100561321518423
she was at least free from the offence of mr	pp=3.3482096104597914
darcys farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak	pp=3.3913894165676415
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr	pp=3.62816917075129
wickham and rejoiced in it	pp=1.9271801240337825
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of mrs	pp=3.585548291477316
bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family mrs	pp=3.8596536390549145
hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves	pp=3.919841085691756
they repulsed every attempt of mrs	pp=1.9470686787346483
bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr	pp=4.052536751266437
collins who was complimenting mr	pp=1.7252423631563514
bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests	pp=3.5911793034904065
bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene mr	pp=2.4431402034841727
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs	pp=2.4714328085845207
hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn	pp=3.9325403102340113
when at length they arose to take leave mrs	pp=3.067881843024125
bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr	pp=3.583962344573486
bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation	pp=3.9138728198036405
of having another daughter married to mr	pp=2.362851513742536
collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure	pp=2.831960563305249
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ the worth of each was eclipsed by mr	pp=4.150776907314873
bingley and netherfield chapter xix	pp=1.7394256280772344
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn mr	pp=3.19211123956951
on finding mrs	pp=2.2608880793149524
bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words  may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning	pp=4.334926869346547
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mrs	pp=3.0576499459485893
bennet instantly answered  oh dearyescertainlyi am sure lizzy will be very happyi am sure she can have no objectioncome kitty i want you up stairs	pp=4.045638643847564
and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out  dear maam do not goi beg you will not gomr	pp=3.6791799882780665
collins must excuse mehe can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear	pp=3.6731464207811673
no no nonsense lizzyi desire you will stay where you areand upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr collins	pp=3.671620296631018
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion mrs	pp=4.2102637348184615
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for this address	pp=4.330159588081934
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken	pp=3.6063423017404097
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life	pp=3.8216471170938635
the idea of mr	pp=2.30145794016654
collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued  my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish	pp=4.07750693987707
secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness	pp=4.593970031658819
jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr	pp=2.86635099298175
this is my advice	pp=1.4138063506270429
allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer	pp=4.351430783193635
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite	pp=3.7520426936477085
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women	pp=3.9983061985217065
but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not be for several years	pp=4.230461096360396
this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem	pp=3.7882536882011806
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection	pp=3.9421634381816997
which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to	pp=4.023983376218608
on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	pp=4.282747867830458
you are too hasty sir she cried	pp=2.5586540749313365
you forget that i have made no answer	pp=3.034291346141375
let me do it without farther loss of time	pp=2.4608137298952726
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me	pp=2.7526667571272383
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them	pp=4.696009184545995
i am not now to learn replied mr	pp=3.3368900582895353
collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time	pp=4.0520706956047015
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	pp=4.385067749384376
i am perfectly serious in my refusalyou could not make _me_ happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ sonay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation	pp=5.043731385453439
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications indeed mr	pp=4.329693024346028
collins all praise of me will be unnecessary	pp=2.314568400784221
you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say	pp=3.409495906543974
i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise	pp=3.5699113365729565
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach	pp=3.9999105048471844
and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr	pp=3.590654399242606
collins thus addressed her  when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character really mr	pp=4.1722525876220935
collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly	pp=2.900073044750055
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one	pp=4.666262963424654
you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course	pp=3.11052775892279
my reasons for believing it are briefly theseit does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable	pp=3.917230601327445
my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you	pp=3.981836264942423
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications	pp=3.618027740725705
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females	pp=3.731218118693456
i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man	pp=4.059761183258087
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere	pp=3.0082737581166423
my feelings in every respect forbid it	pp=2.817086782670436
can i speak plainer	pp=1.4141722978773004
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart	pp=3.356982845575852
you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable	pp=3.982023298830271
to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female chapter xx mr	pp=4.046559460928811
collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs	pp=3.0533669667942975
bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection mr	pp=4.126618712358019
collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	pp=3.8312132087750297
this information however startled mrs	pp=1.7337759422219237
bennetshe would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so	pp=4.20445160717801
but depend upon it mr	pp=1.4808833495960443
collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason	pp=2.5091113183754787
i will speak to her about it myself directly	pp=2.8353797800820195
she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will _make_ her know it	pp=4.162966231745597
pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr	pp=2.7981471927753345
collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state	pp=4.047025540747479
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity	pp=3.895880084291599
sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed	pp=2.5011549888980222
lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these	pp=2.0257019307414605
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived	pp=3.6036694077540257
i will go directly to mr	pp=2.315649339622763
bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure	pp=3.3512142114044297
she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library  oh mr	pp=4.359263145634214
bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar	pp=2.942415191134878
you must come and make lizzy marry mr	pp=2.316076156926973
collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_ mr	pp=3.570711160130179
bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication	pp=3.7217238972121733
i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech	pp=4.6415208105507
of what are you talking of mr	pp=1.9103061444890128
lizzy declares she will not have mr	pp=2.3463559737306072
collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy	pp=4.169840114380639
and what am i to do on the occasionit seems an hopeless business	pp=2.547830417655311
speak to lizzy about it yourself	pp=1.9762406354943536
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him	pp=2.2409069593216553
let her be called down	pp=1.7387285265767163
she shall hear my opinion mrs	pp=1.9833058310340121
come here child cried her father as she appeared	pp=2.464033562821386
i understand that mr	pp=1.4009922873291345
collins has made you an offer of marriage	pp=1.7706804236680151
elizabeth replied that it was	pp=1.7123032456954261
very welland this offer of marriage you have refused	pp=2.817956268257318
i have sir very well	pp=1.9828630177509339
we now come to the point	pp=1.8077205036199515
your mother insists upon your accepting it	pp=2.177375269620276
yes or i will never see her again	pp=2.377557286040212
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parentsyour mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry mr	pp=4.478235048465686
collins and i will never see you again if you _do_	pp=2.335361469088974
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs	pp=4.849241163156275
what do you mean mr	pp=2.1954880263225247
you promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him	pp=2.2103967395025643
my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request	pp=2.7399775755787883
first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room	pp=3.1960243627883695
bennet give up the point	pp=1.9477203311618299
she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns	pp=3.3373030584569308
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interferingand elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	pp=3.5375160748829932
collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	pp=2.585516839977
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way	pp=3.306574514357303
his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret	pp=3.4141221182421373
she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun herewhat do you think has happened this morningmr	pp=3.734519504902462
collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him	pp=2.87921360780878
charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfastroom where mrs	pp=3.926677551326055
bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family	pp=4.312030330687302
charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth	pp=2.7438782480140484
bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own waybut i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead_i_ shall not be able to keep youand so i warn youi have done with you from this very dayi told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word	pp=4.494304170384576
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful childrennot that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body	pp=4.670237555997569
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking	pp=3.576621955983079
those who do not complain are never pitied	pp=2.361861809978749
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation	pp=3.3574237902962323
collins and me have a little conversation together	pp=2.6880270962793795
in a doleful voice mrs	pp=1.7338302553734357
bennet thus began the projected conversationoh mr	pp=2.146257162872104
far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter	pp=3.3945258103228393
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned	pp=4.38368111985894
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation	pp=3.909830562575392
you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr	pp=3.9419511217846654
bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf	pp=3.110145369771368
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own	pp=3.17647126691961
but we are all liable to error	pp=2.51548517015662
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair	pp=2.793747008378569
the discussion of mr	pp=1.6507484350943735
collinss offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother	pp=3.936297956029639
as for the gentleman himself _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence	pp=3.577796621935582
he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend	pp=4.351520609613076
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs	pp=2.1423013700715163
bennets ill humour or ill health mr	pp=2.1854344952077587
collins was also in the same state of angry pride	pp=3.160867627910673
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it	pp=3.835739331757595
he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay	pp=3.167327117542628
after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr	pp=2.778327178333987
wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball	pp=2.7820539286362265
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked overto elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed	pp=4.219789731244184
i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr	pp=3.4877019010822683
darcythat to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself	pp=4.378751208025181
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	pp=3.9087040836624927
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately	pp=2.9622297713727384
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	pp=3.7674723674673904
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs	pp=3.872441638730832
when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said  this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal	pp=3.630095408556539
you shall hear what she says	pp=2.20985441330372
hurst had a house	pp=1.413014258732914
i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence	pp=3.9158960953714845
i depend on you for that	pp=1.9498440586836994
to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr	pp=3.9014550251974445
bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his	pp=4.644172192747695
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country	pp=4.1129261388234815
bingley will not be detained in london by them	pp=3.306103859482795
i will read it to you  when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel	pp=4.393553169358737
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair	pp=4.14567259132485
it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter	pp=3.6069576218308397
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_	pp=3.7004801029501224
why will you think so	pp=1.9799962175362835
it must be his own doinghe is his own master	pp=3.1628641079870405
but you do not know _all_	pp=3.4367380265629217
i _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me	pp=2.5724253235493784
darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again	pp=3.506466327476807
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister	pp=3.8680030519870554
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable	pp=4.892532468189489
my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any womans heart	pp=3.8861213205553877
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many	pp=3.8922315435471053
what think you of _this_ sentence my dear lizzysaid jane as she finished it	pp=3.097170286559522
is it not clear enoughdoes it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard	pp=4.2547211329749475
can there be any other opinion on the subject	pp=2.656795214015076
yes there can for mine is totally differentwill you hear it most willingly	pp=2.8572465939313685
you shall have it in few words	pp=2.1615468528535753
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy	pp=3.8083675798455108
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you	pp=3.7198745507197217
jane shook her head	pp=1.4139343523733128
indeed jane you ought to believe meno one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection	pp=3.3706162754017077
miss bingley i am sure cannot	pp=3.565301338838293
she is not such a simpleton	pp=2.967704109282166
could she have seen half as much love in mr	pp=2.7694327705683457
darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes	pp=3.2560534646307357
but the case is this	pp=1.7244190562027244
we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way	pp=4.159834363373957
but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend	pp=4.117817348568483
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself	pp=3.607793555976759
that is rightyou could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine	pp=4.304587498072687
believe her to be deceived by all means	pp=2.937582079900068
you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer	pp=3.247246895325211
but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere	pp=3.7984685461692735
you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him	pp=4.086726302593569
how can you talk sosaid jane faintly smilingyou must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate	pp=4.559818212863952
i did not think you wouldand that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion	pp=3.548909526914575
a thousand things may arise in six months  the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt	pp=3.561069695517818
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one	pp=4.178753425285816
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	pp=4.424203372787885
janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	pp=3.9159351710927432
bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together	pp=4.2532701100958095
after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr	pp=3.253661324698389
bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses chapter xxii	pp=4.4194761058869
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins	pp=4.419651202103181
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her	pp=2.7794186443911983
it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express	pp=4.330103157515787
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time	pp=3.6422316240531667
this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception ofits object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr	pp=3.5840705556737125
such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon	pp=4.24107669642459
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday	pp=4.171720364315892
his reception however was of the most flattering kind	pp=3.011904335052524
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane	pp=3.839638483386165
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	pp=3.1807648943697417
in as short a time as mr	pp=2.1522613534040747
collinss long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness	pp=3.9477931683078524
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained	pp=3.8778349558318697
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr	pp=3.985128321345522
collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair	pp=3.686605085278697
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr	pp=3.298371289522388
collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st jamess	pp=4.307778168302167
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion	pp=2.9979043132350784
she had gained her point and had time to consider of it	pp=3.0918769109181286
her reflections were in general satisfactory mr	pp=2.3893255598068825
but still he would be her husbandwithout thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for welleducated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want	pp=3.970567383980815
this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it	pp=3.5867452887748414
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person	pp=3.76186069190059
elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation	pp=3.60080271534273
she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr	pp=3.1524617878167756
collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family	pp=3.5593700524262903
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	pp=4.098228830419793
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs	pp=4.106066379938752
bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them	pp=3.9628934635807065
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible	pp=4.965473450846153
they were all astonished and mr	pp=2.7782538803478967
bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said  but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good siryou had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness	pp=3.8909607801441677
my dear sir replied mr	pp=2.1437651353842226
collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyships concurrence	pp=3.809443821823873
you cannot be too much on your guard	pp=3.2449523458065856
risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence	pp=4.49710087557227
believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire	pp=4.155895684100614
as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth	pp=4.22460973489635
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return mrs	pp=3.3879617834290254
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion	pp=4.185380749390836
but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away	pp=3.5568676874295044
miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before	pp=3.9156739582473
the possibility of mr	pp=2.2284737371467167
collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out  engaged to mr	pp=4.2718875041269895
collins my dear charlotteimpossible  the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied  why should you be surprised my dear elizado you think it incredible that mr	pp=3.9731712021783685
collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you	pp=4.36262599643194
but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness	pp=4.145293950680344
i see what you are feeling replied charlotteyou must be surprised very much surprisedso lately as mr	pp=3.205873834605825
collins was wishing to marry you	pp=1.9295104457412011
but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done	pp=5.374604688568177
i am not romantic you know	pp=3.284657569905267
i never was	pp=3.9392166221676614
i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr	pp=2.436865621392214
collinss character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state	pp=3.9207366985283008
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedlyand after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family	pp=3.2156835853215027
charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard	pp=3.1674968967779487
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match	pp=4.2164572138500445
the strangeness of mr	pp=1.4008570956143562
collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted	pp=3.6322804317334114
she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage	pp=4.555534361778183
charlotte the wife of mr	pp=1.5340149198429176
collins was a most humiliating pictureand to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen chapter xxiii	pp=3.988672351415382
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family	pp=4.025613568119843
with many compliments to them and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs	pp=3.613300178114327
bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed  good lord sir william how can you tell such a storydo not you know that mr	pp=4.03622480186793
collins wants to marry lizzy	pp=1.7392191891059892
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy	pp=4.304926801726317
collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london mrs	pp=2.7669644627001007
bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent	pp=4.00950467162727
in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr	pp=3.9518928906443582
collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off	pp=3.5899162195724967
two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	pp=4.156837459260805
nothing could console and nothing appease hernor did that day wear out her resentment	pp=2.8976248570183745
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter mr	pp=4.152957471145084
bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter  jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	pp=4.406243292563099
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr	pp=3.5048447719406446
collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton	pp=3.2268538312386448
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs	pp=3.5366681755960423
bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs	pp=3.823569015585815
bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away	pp=3.3433858719258334
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again	pp=3.256825288444549
the promised letter of thanks from mr	pp=2.3535273848157345
collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted	pp=3.7705971818758424
after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men mr	pp=4.332193232704782
collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet	pp=3.4093710714425556
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husbandit was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesomeshe hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable	pp=4.170053199501214
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs	pp=2.1493241239079324
bingleys continued absence	pp=1.5868684426635424
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject	pp=2.488690531223713
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs	pp=3.9575648830107615
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment	pp=4.22727550822229
as for jane _her_ anxiety under this suspence was of course more painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to	pp=3.833616737563726
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used	pp=4.335641969121105
it needed all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity mr	pp=2.90684658142927
collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction	pp=3.9562170829913446
he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved them from a great deal of his company	pp=3.7969859556545655
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed mrs	pp=4.0723038529048985
bennet was really in a most pitiable state	pp=2.53882159868126
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	pp=3.825108772154556
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her	pp=2.886001074186163
collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr	pp=4.388055213080862
bennet were dead	pp=1.9995109240382622
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband indeed mr	pp=3.3318013892209914
bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for _her_ and live to see her take my place in it  my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts	pp=4.040497247866941
let us hope for better things	pp=1.9792427172095186
let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor	pp=3.079474532470725
this was not very consoling to mrs	pp=2.9146612393662714
bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before  i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate	pp=4.215883285410283
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it	pp=3.8389760561183457
what should not you mind	pp=1.983302499471743
i should not mind any thing at all	pp=2.791218938008926
let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility	pp=3.6631569620654765
bennet for any thing about the entail	pp=2.733936388534943
collins toowhy should _he_ have it more than anybody else	pp=2.794315135312085
i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet	pp=2.7214468356364048

miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt	pp=2.727400811633929
miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it	pp=2.4900901864001463
her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter	pp=3.629860980871275
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr	pp=2.9006486638466273
darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture	pp=3.6201349042802655
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation	pp=3.6912416653975124
her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others	pp=3.8494823438537904
to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit	pp=3.214271302746399
that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations	pp=4.581865021425905
had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself	pp=4.396068030453685
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs	pp=3.9092795603143506
but i will not repine	pp=2.8934176154434623
it cannot last long	pp=1.4121143326360632
he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before	pp=3.677668954742357
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing	pp=3.749262001651264
you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason	pp=2.8018976247330425
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all	pp=3.897570552811773
i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with	pp=3.297320455592459
thank god i have not _that_ pain	pp=3.3068293598501954
a little time thereforei shall certainly try to get the better	pp=2.4061266894343842
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you	pp=3.3110571586651565
i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve	pp=3.481630008150492
nay said elizabeth this is not fair	pp=2.818426435058879
_you_ wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body	pp=3.3957414845690317
_i_ only want to think _you_ perfect and you set yourself against it	pp=2.805297442532098
do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will	pp=3.3265112688214473
you need not	pp=1.0712094252646056
there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well	pp=3.2393745880799765
the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense	pp=3.8960461530653774
i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage	pp=3.7054458620793778
it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable  my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these	pp=3.3742334073120857
they will ruin your happiness	pp=1.7319593352793274
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr	pp=3.5533129778139694
my dear jane mr	pp=1.932516619790194
collins is a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking	pp=4.010900253529008
you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness	pp=3.806989917215081
you alluded to something else	pp=1.7392072758559363
you mentioned _two_ instances	pp=1.4140683289587965
i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk	pp=3.658324547228979
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured	pp=3.720940061757217
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect	pp=4.218056036832511
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us	pp=3.425523133729936
women fancy admiration means more than it does	pp=2.3523584877712587
and men take care that they should	pp=2.1813606222108843
if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine	pp=4.170069458168282
bingleys conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery	pp=3.7922547607739867
thoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution will do the business	pp=3.378319726973204
and do you impute it to either of those	pp=2.726724584922113
yes to the last	pp=1.4124465925429739
but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem	pp=3.3979607372853704
stop me whilst you can	pp=1.7175964789736928
yes in conjunction with his friend	pp=1.9613445956624962
i cannot believe it	pp=1.6303793589940454
why should they try to influence him	pp=2.3637165323786813
they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it	pp=3.5114151907008013
your first position is false	pp=1.7280210366669808
they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride	pp=4.127214176962597
beyond a doubt they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing	pp=3.6508333712091763
they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better	pp=3.4777902283263304
but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers	pp=3.7640121220530505
by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy	pp=3.0449399671580073
do not distress me by the idea	pp=2.3687291360362557
i am not ashamed of having been mistakenor at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters	pp=4.128799111824168
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr	pp=3.686340882972768
bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them mrs	pp=2.7022651525765253
bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity	pp=3.8847228142140717
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs	pp=4.3276414808302945
bennets best comfort was that mr	pp=1.9440196992984717
bingley must be down again in the summer mr	pp=2.4839592063391764
bennet treated the matter differently	pp=1.7406372331369981
i congratulate her	pp=2.2092818723009646
next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then	pp=3.0144748176648957
it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions	pp=3.432175860964534
when is your turn to come	pp=1.938977161696426
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane	pp=3.167272359877154
now is your time	pp=1.4115716558430575
let wickham be _your_ man	pp=1.7382513011965488
he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably	pp=3.433624717630213
thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me	pp=2.7017014092551235
we must not all expect janes good fortune	pp=2.860236247025565
true said mr	pp=1.9717082639691037
bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it mr	pp=4.395322118049072
wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family	pp=3.4556533097051276
they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve	pp=3.3443117682962566
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr	pp=3.798126404625432
darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr	pp=4.631125543533442
darcy before they had known any thing of the matter	pp=3.0401399120285015
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else mr	pp=4.058110431598174
darcy was condemned as the worst of men chapter ii	pp=2.728077619437604
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr	pp=2.768121750818539
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday	pp=3.089215467287004
the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men	pp=3.7015199522525046
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks	pp=3.6380773575483403
on the following monday mrs	pp=2.287222602755133
bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn mr	pp=3.8941348809934566
gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education	pp=3.3833702617904295
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable mrs	pp=4.616313978402684
gardiner who was several years younger than mrs	pp=2.5800655633965457
philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces	pp=3.2755027383703625
between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard	pp=2.992904338317835
they had frequently been staying with her in town	pp=2.7728832932061387
the first part of mrs	pp=1.6890115229770726
gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions	pp=2.8798726057166175
when this was done she had a less active part to play	pp=3.189521691487302
it became her turn to listen mrs	pp=2.1467928313127307
they had all been very illused since she last saw her sister	pp=2.9456231874212047
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it	pp=4.017392321770235
i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr	pp=4.627624066270762
bingley if she could	pp=1.4086461936859684
but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr	pp=4.29225575513218
collinss wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness	pp=3.408286947546067
he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him	pp=3.11910977840619
the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever	pp=4.283612825807672
the lucases are very artful people indeed sister	pp=2.3079722099848734
they are all for what they can get	pp=2.659746781189302
i am sorry to say it of them but so it is	pp=2.9120270775708783
it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else	pp=3.5217561778894453
however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves mrs	pp=4.076928961405827
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject	pp=2.668814427939175
it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she	pp=3.4491587985012626
i am sorry it went off	pp=2.6804693213336606
but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr	pp=3.6609960407632314
bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent	pp=4.054153363003689
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for _us_	pp=3.8911757072027546
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before	pp=4.413885480934386
but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea	pp=3.4747140708834454
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an halfhours acquaintance as to a real strong attachment	pp=3.1255116242812306
pray how _violent was_ mr bingleys love	pp=2.1918111346977374
i never saw a more promising inclination	pp=2.7503404548751846
he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her	pp=2.4515164557421385
every time they met it was more decided and remarkable	pp=3.0582668338428185
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer	pp=3.932952172023232
could there be finer symptoms	pp=1.9995714800732056
is not general incivility the very essence of love	pp=2.417737569409081
oh yesof that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt	pp=3.1257379082383348
poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately	pp=4.023919311887194
it had better have happened to _you_ lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner	pp=3.6384746391962772
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us	pp=3.3839765312659753
change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything	pp=3.2511710294393126
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence	pp=3.338939233194373
i hope added mrs	pp=1.4075216335958558
we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her	pp=4.093358997191315
and _that_ is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr	pp=3.446540450676475
darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr	pp=4.703132337635469
darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr	pp=3.7586876382022485
bingley never stirs without him	pp=1.7239582595785916
so much the better	pp=1.1135360128914917
i hope they will not meet at all	pp=2.690115313203458
but does not jane correspond with the sister	pp=2.314629418625126
_she_ will not be able to help calling	pp=3.30721067459786
she will drop the acquaintance entirely	pp=1.939661854952755
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless	pp=4.092773419399031
it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions	pp=3.8487565029922384
miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by carolines not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him	pp=3.758273866413991
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement mrs	pp=4.105327847959298
when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr	pp=4.000301915775064
wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs	pp=3.302514296047693
gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both	pp=3.0025728701557446
without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment to mrs	pp=4.5899017067015375
gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers	pp=2.842182677951715
about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged	pp=3.636076879180303
they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring mrs	pp=4.456405048677123
gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr	pp=2.4199349939544224
darcy by character perfectly well	pp=1.7368764681552935
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse	pp=2.3288297904399524
in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself	pp=3.377638087617533
on being made acquainted with the present mr	pp=2.652969536505928
darcys treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentlemans reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr	pp=3.7717442386639264
fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured boy chapter iii mrs	pp=3.1410505438640643
gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on  you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly	pp=4.140030882090498
seriously i would have you be on your guard	pp=2.4804028642412166
do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent	pp=3.5011478076777687
i have nothing to say against _him_ he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better	pp=5.500686788625509
but as it isyou must not let your fancy run away with you	pp=3.2794838815731957
your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct i am sure	pp=2.840372002187878
you must not disappoint your father	pp=2.507618162337579
yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise	pp=3.6301333307603034
well then you need not be under any alarm	pp=3.167543840768567
i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too	pp=3.080110112246009
he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it	pp=4.594945043159379
i beg your pardon	pp=1.1136882187203572
i will try again	pp=1.67327675293442
at present i am not in love with mr	pp=4.616731792783532
wickham no i certainly am not	pp=1.984945876315667
but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to mei believe it will be better that he should not	pp=3.938565549016472
i see the imprudence of itoh _that_ abominable mr	pp=2.7993243554945453
my father however is partial to mr wickham	pp=2.518519023226761
in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist	pp=4.583914625322973
all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry	pp=3.6719411736651892
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object	pp=3.9294327635619806
when i am in company with him i will not be wishing	pp=4.546228042847419
in short i will do my best	pp=2.411903029915126
perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often	pp=3.369977172262959
at least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him	pp=2.8505735874843126
as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_	pp=4.287434154067277
but do not imagine that he is always here so often	pp=3.9050536312200674
you know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends	pp=4.163124700730347
but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied	pp=3.6091584065475644
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented mr	pp=3.9996563851738327
collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet	pp=3.900589172441626
his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she _wished_ they might be happy	pp=4.1461273948708675
thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room	pp=4.052165209442733
_that_ you certainly shall	pp=1.412035508568875
and i have another favour to ask	pp=2.9370789676800158
will you come and see me	pp=1.9395641510104902
we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire	pp=2.545565714184649
i am not likely to leave kent for some time	pp=3.8985750467784355
promise me therefore to come to hunsford	pp=2.25930939225335
my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party	pp=4.7871971220982985
indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them	pp=3.343866298844881
the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual	pp=4.154370052825406
elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible	pp=3.8756773103982773
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was	pp=4.238925501761859
charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	pp=4.624982021939697
she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise	pp=3.5061835119263196
it was mr	pp=6.360859059077337
collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest	pp=3.703840612749669
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys	pp=4.217656177166647
jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline	pp=3.5155439504266126
she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost	pp=3.6897074625651194
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley	pp=4.191906006203571
i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london	pp=4.499203912847874
i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her	pp=2.6942594869083405
i enquired after their brother of course	pp=2.1553784460244385
darcy that they scarcely ever saw him	pp=2.193004817312714
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner	pp=2.7244945207419873
i wish i could see her	pp=2.283125386021338
my visit was not long as caroline and mrs	pp=2.7244486716604603
hurst were going out	pp=1.4120731341142012
i dare say i shall soon see them here	pp=3.190419300996155
elizabeth shook her head over this letter	pp=2.4247833984018548
it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr	pp=3.061291926397772
bingley her sisters being in town	pp=1.693890421423173
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention	pp=4.0518629580584795
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer	pp=3.8078937600723597
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt	pp=3.887046761693643
my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me	pp=4.292377722039914
but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion	pp=3.876331860023793
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again	pp=4.407159757970429
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time	pp=3.224906367821708
when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer	pp=4.451929120432403
i pity though i cannot help blaming her	pp=2.670698390343161
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side	pp=3.829819378870787
but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it	pp=4.280498810658896
i need not explain myself farther and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable	pp=3.932608983080875
i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago	pp=3.85748587521337
he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy	pp=4.322550317763815
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt	pp=3.6656645817029188
let me hear from you very soon	pp=2.538118711257951
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty	pp=3.2870870363060085
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford	pp=3.4312744789246463
pray go to see them with sir william and maria	pp=3.3523418835183314
this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least	pp=3.5162630949038713
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over	pp=2.651588504718829
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions	pp=3.9861924312740395
his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr	pp=3.8911867083664755
darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away mrs	pp=3.5307174759799977
gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	pp=3.618369154084734
his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else	pp=3.7017241156566683
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain	pp=3.8511959340575763
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it	pp=4.280890897239575
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in his case than in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	pp=4.4969948913853734
nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy	pp=3.9420463331020685
all this was acknowledged to mrs	pp=2.4378341765731473
gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went oni am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil	pp=4.225173543360132
but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_ they are even impartial towards miss king	pp=3.021616495168245
i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl	pp=4.600018262794332
there can be no love in all this	pp=2.489254844422621
my watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance	pp=4.138698168609706
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do	pp=3.374610691652412
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away	pp=3.4524646875134613
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford	pp=2.150641341079235
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty	pp=4.207347954867317
there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	pp=4.206298193014276
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay	pp=3.9456968927304157
every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch	pp=3.0811634284527685
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be	pp=3.3813343900619404
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter	pp=4.106336858309374
the farewell between herself and mr	pp=2.168202689689149
wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more	pp=3.028822523830236
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of hertheir opinion of every bodywould always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing	pp=4.28388867197848
her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable	pp=4.0147458623383745
sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good humoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise	pp=4.1612906068111615
elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too long	pp=3.296620577789042
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information	pp=3.283982383315814
it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurchstreet by noon	pp=4.397955157425936
as they drove to mr	pp=1.9624401753253717
gardiners door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever	pp=4.023494817751456
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower	pp=4.132719955535689
all was joy and kindness	pp=1.680157506742525
the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres	pp=4.116318644513626
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt	pp=2.4771760294646397
their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection	pp=4.095103481247251
it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long mrs	pp=3.695392353897943
gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurchstreet and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance mrs	pp=3.8093468661085654
gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well	pp=2.974396412158839
but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king	pp=3.5715918994145097
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary	pp=2.535079599398685
pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive	pp=3.7737222917923794
where does discretion end and avarice begin	pp=2.1599935371245507
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary	pp=4.893956370123791
if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think	pp=4.030721367527478
she is a very good kind of girl i believe	pp=3.38412318066221
i know no harm of her	pp=1.9262123487958411
but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune	pp=3.5179987408666453
nowhy should he	pp=1.5741625588919355
if it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor	pp=4.554644582051553
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event	pp=3.1037449053291746
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe	pp=3.3881932342248726
if _she_ does not object to it why should _we_	pp=2.690025564508958
_her_ not objecting does not justify _him_	pp=2.195766327740209
it only shews her being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling	pp=2.681590568778614
well cried elizabeth have it as you choose	pp=2.3263791276356716
no lizzy that is what i do _not_ choose	pp=2.8861905585572494
i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire	pp=4.216042759795244
oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better	pp=4.3197451998933944
i am sick of them all	pp=1.8989352947923082
thank heaven i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him	pp=3.8495601492773255
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all	pp=2.5853236217485773
take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment	pp=2.453970293076523
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer	pp=4.035724813788244
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs	pp=3.197495104991837
gardiner but perhaps to the lakes	pp=2.141376804841605
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful	pp=4.042336941075142
my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour	pp=3.533152814568964
adieu to disappointment and spleen	pp=1.6823801755454448
what are men to rocks and mountains	pp=2.0955630701057224
we _will_ know where we have gonewe _will_ recollect what we have seen	pp=3.1377175234809283
lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation	pp=3.6076715880531998
let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers chapter v	pp=3.3499844463910735
every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight	pp=4.1118109501474995
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view	pp=3.563692997402509
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side	pp=2.488519546658519
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants	pp=3.7218744107655954
at length the parsonage was discernible	pp=2.219444977680808
the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving mr	pp=3.3132006673482013
collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party	pp=3.6520027442559666
in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other mrs	pp=5.5244654012759895
collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received	pp=3.870667728895217
she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family	pp=3.959977296408716
they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment	pp=4.131733381470613
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him	pp=4.8576181058630485
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when mr	pp=4.2249332879043235
collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte	pp=3.536224940177424
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr	pp=4.130538354533871
collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself	pp=3.7027623016071094
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible	pp=3.6811850366833108
here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind	pp=3.438727393421786
he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump	pp=3.6005383852234734
it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground	pp=3.553023477161963
from his garden mr	pp=1.3981588283151638
collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husbands help	pp=4.185346890900186
it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr	pp=3.6195703400969603
collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten	pp=3.7533433333087816
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country	pp=3.3061991869127816
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr	pp=3.3733086804370043
she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over	pp=3.8981382587923092
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here	pp=3.6097821993476056
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming	pp=2.7860763611094304
we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home	pp=3.1266165245024453
her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us	pp=2.5510462930251454
i _should_ say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several	pp=3.326506142932978
lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour	pp=4.022223272939921
very true my dear that is exactly what i say	pp=2.5735165803286626
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference	pp=3.6728512135877374
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well	pp=4.068118954830704
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr	pp=3.2349431558847135
collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings	pp=2.6454416907517366
a lively imagination soon settled it all	pp=2.1759220310233056
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her	pp=3.979175631758445
she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out  oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the diningroom for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is	pp=4.7283017322970755
make haste and come down this moment	pp=2.3510331220557092
elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate	pp=3.926645376110968
and is this all cried elizabeth	pp=1.9831330642744167
i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter  la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine	pp=4.11658556583963
the old lady is mrs	pp=1.7252534085118076
the other is miss de bourgh	pp=2.2361383527601126
only look at her	pp=1.3878672160855585
she is quite a little creature	pp=1.969896554295808
who would have thought she could be so thin and small  she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind	pp=4.04306051248863
why does she not come in	pp=1.9662752186111476
oh charlotte says she hardly ever does	pp=2.183053979395719
i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas	pp=2.6118521968949766
she will make him a very proper wife mr	pp=2.7938565692647
collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way	pp=3.861115052531875
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house mr	pp=4.252760168488122
collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day chapter vi mr	pp=4.384122470093815
collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	pp=3.0944080021767095
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	pp=4.251245549580191
i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings	pp=4.400282468053379
i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen	pp=3.4244561918839995
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this	pp=3.210300749956687
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival  i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire	pp=4.30807665465094
about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	pp=2.6795737922287177
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings mr	pp=3.7421169304335637
collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them	pp=3.929568246691291
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth  do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel	pp=3.830253090769828
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter	pp=2.901666844763985
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more	pp=4.101771927356874
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved	pp=3.3509037714452528
while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinnersuch formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st jamess	pp=4.329825622644414
when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calmelizabeths courage did not fail her	pp=3.1986287529855626
from the entrance hall of which mr	pp=2.133966594477485
collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an antichamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs	pp=3.476078396676065
jenkinson were sittingher ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs	pp=3.2056268945271507
collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary	pp=4.12792209958113
jamess sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look	pp=4.313559289681412
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedlylady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome	pp=3.538241273808223
she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr	pp=3.734433705495993
wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented	pp=4.112760068015186
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr	pp=3.2578597856401057
darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small	pp=3.672610509401629
there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies	pp=2.761685055017101
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs	pp=3.5246223700150963
jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes	pp=3.942254603975903
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr	pp=4.5526537313485855
collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer	pp=4.0158227673531215
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr	pp=3.448389578908233
collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greaterhe carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear	pp=4.062644691770932
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them	pp=3.6398399938751926
the party did not supply much conversation	pp=2.191719663891836
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time mrs	pp=4.282522654542133
jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed	pp=3.611841725708263
maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire	pp=3.8696909872001104
when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted	pp=4.5431419560219775
she enquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry	pp=4.175859937234993
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs	pp=2.285171007648256
collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs	pp=3.63843020062671
collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl	pp=3.3078560160245543
she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden nameelizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedlylady catherine then observed  your fathers estate is entailed on mr	pp=4.524593241560207
collins i think	pp=1.9963032372874696
for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female lineit was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourghs familydo you play and sing miss bennet a little	pp=3.789180314818166
oh thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you	pp=3.6135809349999843
our instrument is a capital one probably superior toyou shall try it some daydo your sisters play and sing	pp=3.151139458989447
one of them does	pp=2.1054648767368844
why did not you all learnyou ought all to have learned	pp=2.77933960838586
the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yoursdo you draw	pp=3.2231539284947375
no not at all	pp=1.407905900858208
what none of you not one	pp=1.9702896113951935
that is very strange	pp=1.998958123323946
but i suppose you had no opportunity	pp=2.783877529197872
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters	pp=2.9067951808479
my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london	pp=3.319267374302916
has your governess left you	pp=1.7215592880204107
we never had any governess	pp=1.9922606496218225
no governess how was that possible	pp=1.956330295188722
five daughters brought up at home without a governessi never heard of such a thing	pp=3.76105421945128
who attended to you	pp=1.3981893602395703
without a governess you must have been neglected	pp=3.5718807176943437
compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means	pp=3.243625513452693
we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary	pp=3.1565672177990933
aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one	pp=4.305363041390128
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it	pp=3.393504554446526
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way	pp=3.7714202167989215
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out	pp=3.1035619687162956
four nieces of mrs	pp=1.408097246546615
jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her mrs	pp=4.010117931599033
collins did i tell you of lady metcalfes calling yesterday to thank me	pp=3.020719224132105
she finds miss pope a treasure	pp=1.9702205602943939
yes maam all	pp=1.9718923589525732
allwhat all five out at once	pp=1.9830906261782204
very oddand you only the secondthe younger ones out before the elder are marriedyour younger sisters must be very young	pp=3.480383769526274
yes my youngest is not sixteen	pp=1.9769914854912842
perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company	pp=2.7230567872501004
but really maam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry earlythe last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first	pp=4.3892035241646905
and to be kept back on _such_ a motivei think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind	pp=3.9029157151426785
upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a personpray what is your age	pp=3.567923078914618
with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it	pp=3.318819427178702
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	pp=4.171169984926857
you cannot be more than twenty i am suretherefore you need not conceal your age	pp=3.615077275138022
i am not one and twenty	pp=2.713993839116871
when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed	pp=3.104695694270074
lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs	pp=2.7555468629115323
collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs	pp=4.542015132064489
jenkinson to make up her party	pp=1.9194156809812581
their table was superlatively stupid	pp=1.7409228461179342
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs	pp=3.003696154140089
jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light	pp=3.3693774866825477
a great deal more passed at the other table	pp=3.3502045427514844
lady catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself mr	pp=3.327861552493898
collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many	pp=3.433135011380076
sir william did not say much	pp=2.1474318079954484
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names	pp=2.558466906022546
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broke up the carriage was offered to mrs	pp=3.7403393113344947
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow	pp=3.4186124444160355
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr	pp=3.379597449312395
collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed	pp=2.707326567531953
as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was	pp=4.703961401483135
but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr	pp=3.418206048507908
collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands chapter vii	pp=3.816948112879152
while sir william was with them mr	pp=2.8743303435877827
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the diningparlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr	pp=4.033283452274337
collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement	pp=3.393632233340369
from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr	pp=2.902694558846867
collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day	pp=4.008262768855538
very few days passed in which mr	pp=2.505516784036476
collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours	pp=4.321301274729161
now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits	pp=4.261264105810395
she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs	pp=4.058417452593848
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr	pp=3.8260075138061165
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first	pp=4.0512489782247565
their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach	pp=3.474613358199639
this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors	pp=3.967116615053452
her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity	pp=4.821727377061118
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	pp=2.8095136061679877
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important	pp=4.012209243440936
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr	pp=2.462052670127037
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr	pp=3.0319769405362313
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects	pp=2.81604100461587
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr	pp=3.4613846883105586
darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord  and to the great surprise of all the party when mr	pp=3.854672013694627
charlotte had seen them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding  i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr	pp=3.594447642829442
darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me	pp=2.9603347701152067
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room	pp=3.45686681736539
collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure	pp=3.5744861510179815
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word	pp=2.3096098872930986
collins sat for some time without speaking to any body	pp=2.5344331907611286
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family	pp=3.1486156314412885
she answered him in the usual way and after a moments pause added  my eldest sister has been in town these three months	pp=4.307614960816522
have you never happened to see her there	pp=2.800830009155519
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet	pp=4.39033652636278
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings	pp=4.050886223855797
it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easterday almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening	pp=4.7695686307214995
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter	pp=3.513050678602831
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr	pp=3.5721594092766975
darcy they had only seen at church	pp=2.1910946773554136
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawingroom	pp=3.306123537769779
her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room	pp=4.532890370393994
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs	pp=3.4388849402206247
collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much	pp=2.6038357594178945
he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darcy	pp=4.095441478569426
_his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out  what is that you are saying fitzwilliam	pp=4.132487571292606
what is it you are talking of	pp=2.20665622282137
what are you telling miss bennet	pp=2.6079910431754745
let me hear what it is	pp=2.0156189340117643
we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply	pp=3.390155932785519
of music then pray speak aloud	pp=1.9982539705965687
it is of all subjects my delight	pp=2.5434213806267825
i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music	pp=3.4003292034147794
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste	pp=3.2475380517283563
if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient	pp=5.846093539237363
and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply	pp=3.0843210753194423
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully	pp=4.06288105206082
how does georgiana get on darcy mr	pp=2.179147257374809
darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency	pp=2.658809951112152
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal	pp=4.047153231878329
i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice	pp=3.8438364043913067
so much the better	pp=1.1135360128914917
it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account	pp=3.750315039391972
i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice	pp=3.4936693462374957
i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs	pp=3.6575066593966645
collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrs jenkinsons room	pp=4.39322854434548
darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts ill breeding and made no answer	pp=2.985488060196528
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument	pp=3.910054247556261
darcy by coming in all this state to hear me	pp=2.7377401017489498
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others	pp=3.4940280587200543
i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own	pp=4.947110814327062
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say	pp=3.9686269192180443
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr	pp=4.04125459490624
darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me leave to say very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear	pp=3.868998378683014
i am not afraid of you said he smilingly	pp=3.1998152678878635
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam	pp=3.541892768104753
i should like to know how he behaves among strangers	pp=3.22741445701276
you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful	pp=2.8040941528300003
he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain youbut so it was	pp=3.077742221942542
darcy you cannot deny the fact	pp=2.140157487410108
i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party	pp=4.309340095943804
true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room	pp=2.683952410248805
well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next	pp=2.5683273542462084
my fingers wait your orders	pp=1.7334938380066836
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this	pp=2.9460481648474586
said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam	pp=1.9981857445057574
shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers	pp=4.46355455829465
i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him	pp=2.6797119641423666
it is because he will not give himself the trouble	pp=2.8662557351540263
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before	pp=3.763724985661146
i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done	pp=3.0941276526544494
they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression	pp=3.570088210497297
but then i have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i would not take the trouble of practising	pp=4.459626803860694
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution	pp=4.1359537901475925
darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right	pp=2.5670525655076104
you have employed your time much better	pp=2.192580983756434
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting	pp=2.9992319552338533
we neither of us perform to strangers	pp=2.1466076109082457
here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of	pp=3.7973242405373697
elizabeth immediately began playing again	pp=1.737248567046406
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy  miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master	pp=3.7555535508240068
anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn	pp=3.991133238348812
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste	pp=3.048883590144827
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home chapter ix	pp=4.381189732985425
collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor	pp=3.7801265849462786
as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr	pp=4.583252399400914
darcy and mr	pp=3.6958438346194127
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within	pp=4.023604027140719
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence	pp=3.6167559057268397
it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed  how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr	pp=4.356439867080433
darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr	pp=4.047871691616388
he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london	pp=3.729906508722088
perfectly soi thank you	pp=1.397716877709611
she found that she was to receive no other answerand after a short pause added  i think i have understood that mr	pp=4.297106375867084
bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again	pp=2.444145731697759
i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future	pp=4.07718270100196
he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing	pp=3.4931674050496855
if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there	pp=4.120356977326699
bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle	pp=3.955220457797235
i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers	pp=4.651740194825667
elizabeth made no answer	pp=1.1655386630951445
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him	pp=3.9987507733627585
he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house	pp=2.9989212468723903
lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr	pp=3.4238653054887753
collins first came to hunsford	pp=1.6894964443628706
collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife	pp=2.4997270923068267
yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had	pp=4.104578412968658
collins as the wisest thing she ever did	pp=2.353144655137863
she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her	pp=3.9400908586273746
an easy distance do you call it	pp=2.372519144722754
it is nearly fifty miles	pp=1.74044004328488
and what is fifty miles of good road	pp=2.6731206137362107
little more than half a days journey	pp=2.432000040222967
yes i call it a _very_ easy distance	pp=2.3373007014654474
i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match cried elizabeth	pp=3.482351390543923
i should never have said mrs	pp=2.2160169388575497
collins was settled _near_ her family	pp=1.9691434484265984
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire	pp=4.439403045619657
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far	pp=2.964557285752067
as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered  i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family	pp=5.158612998683143
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil	pp=3.4713133922285784
but that is not the case _here_ mr and mrs	pp=3.8320827701823155
collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance mr	pp=3.6914208795655385
darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said _you_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment	pp=3.568517224593953
_you_ cannot have been always at longbourn	pp=2.6621063325882153
elizabeth looked surprised	pp=2.877233404257462
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice  are you pleased with kent	pp=3.620580276238676
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk	pp=3.912346056881541
the têteàtête surprised them mr	pp=1.7197165660202967
my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way	pp=4.384355145242728
but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year	pp=4.284600524987861
all field sports were over	pp=1.7296750960421083
within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day	pp=3.9626414230588023
they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt	pp=3.6695176737603434
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners she believed he might have the best informed mind	pp=4.51117136285889
darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand	pp=3.148736308815178
it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself	pp=3.984308804604685
he seldom appeared really animated mrs	pp=1.991334092578949
collins knew not what to make of him	pp=2.324757169068852
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable	pp=4.500404536214487
it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind	pp=3.4713307998644964
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs	pp=4.381754826021839
collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power	pp=4.231121174953775
in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam	pp=2.849410353910471
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr	pp=3.642703623851572
darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all chapter x	pp=3.380990810302144
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr	pp=3.2724765333411985
darcyshe felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hershow it could occur a second time therefore was very oddyet it did and even a third	pp=4.1003485313730295
it seemed like wilful illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her	pp=3.909839035479309
he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs	pp=4.206796528034726
his words seemed to imply it	pp=1.919311017721403
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts	pp=2.3352477669435037
it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage	pp=3.9897486562704074
she was engaged one day as she walked in reperusing janes last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr	pp=4.078829732351432
darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her	pp=2.9983422357280007
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said  i did not know before that you ever walked this way	pp=3.322296696011248
i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage	pp=3.9807065773694053
are you going much farther	pp=1.7353651967926695
no i should have turned in a moment	pp=3.1295241464949712
and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together	pp=3.0526030742159227
yesif darcy does not put it off again	pp=2.7884292917896283
but i am at his disposal	pp=2.8914889209172183
he arranges the business just as he pleases	pp=2.5603488292930585
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice	pp=3.770048958031151
he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam	pp=3.1336432592796
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor	pp=3.6088655097833793
i speak feelingly	pp=2.713769832798166
a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and dependence	pp=2.721319417893302
now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and dependence	pp=2.9208251547754283
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for	pp=3.3605071899571666
these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature	pp=3.3545893548093466
but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money	pp=3.2229502570035855
unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do	pp=2.9041113518100357
is this thought elizabeth meant for me	pp=2.1781886224855085
and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earls younger son	pp=3.768256684560426
unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds	pp=3.614707636565692
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped	pp=3.522244775505418
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said  i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal	pp=3.758351461426641
i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind	pp=3.326311317014741
but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her	pp=3.798544405931172
no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me	pp=3.060454381993987
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy	pp=3.580223077090745
are you indeed	pp=4.22401927040787
and pray what sort of guardians do you make	pp=3.197156590608815
does your charge give you much trouble	pp=2.1862098295171757
young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way	pp=4.069197684149996
as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth	pp=4.1363671725511155
i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world	pp=4.144802760635969
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs	pp=3.822592929079153
i think i have heard you say that you know them	pp=2.2087338632224998
i know them a little	pp=1.7132281973812036
their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe is a great friend of darcys	pp=3.538773712063003
oh yes said elizabeth drilymr	pp=1.7348932342294476
darcy is uncommonly kind to mr	pp=1.9313262831717823
bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him	pp=2.5338117129706235
care of himyes i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care	pp=3.838911773569607
from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him	pp=3.476760727396268
but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant	pp=4.726332196212217
what is it you mean	pp=1.7982616722362161
it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing	pp=4.435323763950686
you may depend upon my not mentioning it	pp=1.8964413422786932
what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer did mr	pp=4.407095674850068
darcy give you his reasons for this interference	pp=2.341565502128131
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady	pp=1.8822174534435798
and what arts did he use to separate them	pp=2.4505240424667294
he only told me what i have now told you	pp=2.770913180407214
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation	pp=2.8155280916597523
after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful	pp=3.0309593421908088
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she	pp=3.872884347547811
your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings	pp=2.355718453427433
why was he to be the judge	pp=2.9695991012299654
you are rather disposed to call his interference officious	pp=2.458695244724687
i do not see what right mr	pp=3.7322357424938195
darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy	pp=4.1186053416659325
but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him	pp=3.568747023476912
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case	pp=3.891567143975932
that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly	pp=4.3981364540543
this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr	pp=2.8705464383676147
darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage	pp=3.994523397708801
there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard	pp=4.337720657801922
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected	pp=3.2701301016086552
there could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom mr	pp=3.8462797004992164
darcy could have such boundless influence	pp=1.9941676944430302
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr	pp=3.499304259692098
bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them	pp=4.391903121974538
if his own vanity however did not mislead him _he_ was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer	pp=4.212644165849759
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted	pp=4.00184067629965
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliams words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london	pp=2.9786654073916914
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection	pp=2.875883728405152
when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr	pp=3.8517585986270806
darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr	pp=4.613134910930438
bingley for his sister	pp=1.6773364384452143
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr	pp=3.397534420823315
darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea mrs	pp=3.643272128435781
collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr	pp=3.9513317014152993
collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather displeased by her staying at home chapter xi	pp=3.6782471446972673
when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr	pp=3.645842681236253
darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent	pp=3.6733905771930555
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded	pp=4.121996877838757
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal mr	pp=3.7683126913171825
darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings	pp=4.437162055235396
she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him	pp=5.147947204667833
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her	pp=4.124961938295648
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better	pp=3.438516077053102
she answered him with cold civility	pp=2.204741532686296
elizabeth was surprised but said not a word	pp=2.0640922479839623
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began  in vain have i struggled	pp=3.292366681982351
it will not do	pp=1.4769048959377318
my feelings will not be repressed	pp=3.0723826170689716
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you	pp=3.178947059575956
elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression	pp=1.9981366622838683
she stared coloured doubted and was silent	pp=2.3603420848577144
he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride	pp=4.262347017504761
his sense of her inferiorityof its being a degradationof the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit	pp=3.672750695239922
in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger	pp=4.827768290052503
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand	pp=4.67584674953715
as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer	pp=4.002184568920415
he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security	pp=2.7654920039977626
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said  in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned	pp=4.028418189096072
it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could _feel_ gratitude i would now thank you	pp=3.6498711031953666
but i cannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly	pp=3.3189145054388445
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one	pp=2.757303245224294
it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration	pp=4.11145944461567
the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation mr	pp=3.710128389662792
darcy who was leaning against the mantlepiece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise	pp=3.470106734883893
his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature	pp=3.1142494978613926
he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it	pp=3.643697539687018
the pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful	pp=2.1562061527770218
at length in a voice of forced calmness he said  and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little _endeavour_ at civility i am thus rejected	pp=4.572002711169977
but it is of small importance	pp=3.175298596255687
i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character	pp=3.681059390803284
was not this some excuse for incivility if i _was_ uncivil	pp=2.7039584975038737
but i have other provocations	pp=2.476866694632774
you know i have	pp=1.664694930320564
had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister	pp=4.590486133270874
as she pronounced these words mr	pp=1.9839476966962142
darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued	pp=3.314712567443573
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_	pp=2.735135289931975
you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind	pp=4.016661037650888
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse	pp=3.9669593572414765
can you deny that you have done it she repeated	pp=3.1126704780413212
with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success	pp=4.383222271195837
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her	pp=3.894978680174098
but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded	pp=3.789988245061739
long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided	pp=3.075169420119523
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham	pp=3.005850916226724
on this subject what can you have to say	pp=3.3430644802200566
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others	pp=2.6202585998779084
you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour	pp=3.752578804380082
his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed	pp=2.800005316998625
and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy	pp=2.703811882647716
you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty	pp=2.8991782499965724
you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him	pp=3.09859673364483
you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert	pp=3.3111170628506574
you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule	pp=3.510569681883739
and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully	pp=3.883607247640228
my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design	pp=3.72662705956514
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing	pp=4.039525936353664
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence	pp=2.357380708660217
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related	pp=2.6107937096875404
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections	pp=2.9347353730554793
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said  you are mistaken mr	pp=3.922773171087703
darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner	pp=3.242511351588273
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued  you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it	pp=4.1502608352395995
again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification	pp=3.193844587367798
she went on	pp=1.9705689678667515
from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry	pp=4.401200038420097
you have said quite enough madam	pp=1.9958665442664574
i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been	pp=3.30604394084468
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house	pp=3.5572110915068653
she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour	pp=3.2542203469133177
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr	pp=2.9575829066419814
darcy that he should have been in love with her for so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	pp=4.840371853323614
but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr	pp=4.064923149588565
wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	pp=4.113988248978923
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room chapter xii	pp=4.226388042460752
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes	pp=3.507208617869081
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise	pp=4.657321205649968
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr	pp=3.170957200456069
darcys sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road	pp=3.4352846295597415
the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground	pp=3.8261394405316422
she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr	pp=3.8365856740012725
darcy she was directly retreating	pp=1.7405625325321408
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name	pp=3.9654153123695797
she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr	pp=4.200751020979562
darcy she moved again towards the gate	pp=2.156629319253705
he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you	pp=4.2265356276975785
will you do me the honour of reading that letterand then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight	pp=3.7893776902626746
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close handthe envelope itself was likewise fullpursuing her way along the lane she then began it	pp=3.821463021624684
it was dated from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows  be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you	pp=3.7114415540694123
i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read	pp=4.413531871743283
you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice	pp=3.4076510825866526
two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge	pp=3.696828354062399
the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr	pp=2.8839850896116346
bingley from your sisterand the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr	pp=3.849766465015117
he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided	pp=3.4693910509129786
from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him	pp=4.093372838568467
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probableif it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable	pp=3.8995819753041547
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of bothi will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connectionhe left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returningthe part which i acted is now to be explainedhis sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in londonwe accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choicei described and enforced them earnestlybut however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference	pp=4.208452525544631
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regardbut bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his ownto convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point	pp=3.894380557562353
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a momenti cannot blame myself for having done thus much	pp=3.715357310146796
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town	pp=4.342433616157843
if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn themwith respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr	pp=4.118994291783012
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity mr	pp=4.473991292418098
wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed	pp=4.558317420574355
my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridgemost important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education	pp=4.1601523428061045
my father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it	pp=4.051960956548386
as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner	pp=4.375973297953294
the vicious propensitiesthe want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr	pp=3.878704717335355
darcy could not have	pp=1.407637001872687
here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell	pp=3.1807686306832523
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr	pp=2.5388727992724385
wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character	pp=3.1855370354922923
it adds even another motive	pp=1.7393489100502535
my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr	pp=3.045289596134841
wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant	pp=4.400218857324952
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds	pp=2.4034132741310534
wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited	pp=4.452444175099529
i knew that mr	pp=1.8145725526839829
wickham ought not to be a clergyman	pp=3.5454893616573515
the business was therefore soon settled	pp=2.2375251901091144
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds	pp=4.114643266112674
all connection between us seemed now dissolved	pp=2.201927048399415
i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town	pp=3.4634279764612095
in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation	pp=3.494903323917291
for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation	pp=3.891598773328079
his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad	pp=4.053052704513752
he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in questionof which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions	pp=4.749632988343015
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it	pp=3.5932754554023845
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself	pp=3.420087111890001
after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt	pp=2.6606091627666926
how he lived i know not	pp=1.9643116956000863
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice	pp=2.779954963007628
having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy	pp=3.4184227914196352
my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself	pp=3.7087165486486207
about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr	pp=3.6584085193868967
wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs	pp=3.8659998391760393
younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement	pp=4.09612659249358
she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself	pp=3.732519429680829
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me	pp=3.7443484061557246
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted	pp=2.7407411495602365
regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr	pp=2.984634449522152
younge was of course removed from her charge mr	pp=3.1784139300067027
his revenge would have been complete indeed	pp=3.432325450269152
this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham	pp=3.736646730325994
i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at	pp=3.707902150352735
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination	pp=4.027738540171459
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night	pp=3.3152505894096986
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed	pp=3.9006554240113096
for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions	pp=3.881110240908621
if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning	pp=4.179826152398074
i will only add god bless you fitzwilliam darcy chapter xiii	pp=2.721537296085429
if elizabeth when mr	pp=1.4026667384474654
darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents	pp=3.699905683207011
but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited	pp=3.7230653824506157
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined	pp=2.941582234825542
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal	pp=4.157807914539176
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield	pp=3.5377239993427003
she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes	pp=3.766691133423935
his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice	pp=4.0223231360802645
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty	pp=3.7897306658142766
it was all pride and insolence	pp=2.538768274535082
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr	pp=2.777499815153887
wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition	pp=3.8115846983697868
she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehoodand when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again	pp=4.58271373528375
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr	pp=3.684266469628055
so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great	pp=3.368854756554061
but when she read and reread with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate	pp=3.713194631083469
she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success	pp=3.5828506200759493
on both sides it was only assertion	pp=2.885684259756626
again she read on	pp=1.4011874656735934
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr	pp=3.8164093782353996
darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole	pp=3.4067257125758643
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr	pp=2.717744979967588
wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice	pp=3.359515871397294
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance	pp=4.3700743159467175
of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself	pp=3.310723633628397
as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring	pp=4.395573649309607
his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue	pp=3.2023554048093064
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr	pp=3.5539654256036854
darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr	pp=3.483659021887463
darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance	pp=2.703799914293596
after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read	pp=3.105509528290549
but alas the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question	pp=4.214352046722698
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr	pp=3.9141088671340545
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr philipss	pp=3.400518985388985
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory	pp=2.5830934895449107
she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before	pp=3.459759540719454
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct	pp=3.86596807134753
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcythat mr	pp=4.049713697424176
darcy might leave the country but that _he_ should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week	pp=3.721252347303766
she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr	pp=4.230910020265559
darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son	pp=3.6366122608850557
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing	pp=4.075065793340372
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn	pp=3.935646119780697
darcy she could not but allow that mr	pp=3.9372519658665444
bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustany thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits	pp=4.178201073555641
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling	pp=4.2064918647919844
that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr	pp=4.247275218732342
she grew absolutely ashamed of herselfof neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd	pp=3.9328012342472847
how despicably have i acted she criedi who have prided myself on my discernmenti who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrusthow humiliating is this discoveryyet how just a humiliationhad i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind	pp=4.052901794641841
but vanity not love has been my follypleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned	pp=3.783127346794304
till this moment i never knew myself	pp=2.1814262385100935
from herself to janefrom jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr	pp=3.6337034173738623
darcys explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient and she read it again	pp=2.9058487936221007
widely different was the effect of a second perusalhow could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the otherhe declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachmentand she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always beenneither could she deny the justice of his description of janeshe felt that janes feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility	pp=4.4149321352391375
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe	pp=4.352644547982928
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers	pp=3.9656972245879025
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt	pp=4.299163819363757
it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus selfattracted by the rest of her familyand as she considered that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before	pp=4.292850612940593
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought reconsidering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	pp=4.259105799661126
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr	pp=3.334342078127838
darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be foundelizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it	pp=4.061327314281173
she could think only of her letter chapter xiv	pp=3.1926456332949518
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr	pp=3.7056821498311328
collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings	pp=3.63686360396648
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyships indignation would have been	pp=4.222474876846794
what would she have saidhow would she have behaved	pp=2.9011654813494947
but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to methey were excessively sorry to go but so they always are	pp=4.173547957853663
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year	pp=3.412243609672428
his attachment to rosings certainly increases mr	pp=2.5633596919125425
collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	pp=3.433139664037593
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added  but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer mrs	pp=4.319054566606504
collins will be very glad of your company i am sure	pp=3.0006381435426164
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept iti must be in town next saturday	pp=4.175046309304156
i expected you to stay two months	pp=2.1272756809556532
i told mrs	pp=3.2301851672671065
collins so before you came	pp=1.7229201651933794
there can be no occasion for your going so soon mrs	pp=2.673861270075554
bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight	pp=2.344243807315994
but my father cannothe wrote last week to hurry my return	pp=2.8610851918356937
oh your father of course may spare you if your mother candaughters are never of so much consequence to a father	pp=3.1743079780488057
and if you will stay another _month_ complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large	pp=4.809176394517799
you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan	pp=3.5279084141229284
lady catherine seemed resigned mrs	pp=2.286773872031003
collins you must send a servant with them	pp=2.5141430839323196
you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves	pp=4.007362818266496
you must contrive to send somebody	pp=1.9415808730639714
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thingyoung women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life	pp=3.878590050192651
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with hermiss darcy the daughter of mr	pp=3.638529822413835
darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manneri am excessively attentive to all those things	pp=4.05275430846373
you must send john with the young ladies mrs collins	pp=3.0799009718727253
ohyour unclehe keeps a manservant does hei am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things	pp=3.3007278652323553
where shall you change horsesoh bromley of courseif you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to	pp=3.5382173124491216
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was	pp=4.406128606912633
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections mr	pp=4.027952543015012
darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart	pp=3.4458851328323745
she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different	pp=3.244373592415065
when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion	pp=3.933931044373743
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again	pp=4.185143484151748
in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	pp=4.190966153046464
they were hopeless of remedy	pp=1.682377423520683
her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil	pp=3.6970658277230233
catherine weakspirited irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless would scarcely give them a hearing	pp=3.3943748832155065
they were ignorant idle and vain	pp=2.19911710896922
while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever	pp=3.833457185102284
anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr	pp=2.5649584309434195
darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost	pp=3.4265977927916236
how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family  when to these recollections was added the developement of wickhams character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	pp=3.977958909439422
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first	pp=3.8760124609855997
the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh	pp=4.334087845005585
when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both chapter xv	pp=4.1361660150010495
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr	pp=1.9292285742307023
collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary	pp=4.1168848602612895
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs	pp=3.0182907308612075
collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it	pp=4.407614099498654
the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you	pp=2.9555781933015193
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode	pp=2.894969203992541
our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly	pp=3.876677135861989
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness	pp=2.5219393918905313
collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied  it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably	pp=4.193308417791358
we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome	pp=3.7046886568977726
our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast	pp=3.771393266500072
you see on what a footing we are	pp=2.3455665362855194
you see how continually we are engaged there	pp=2.3651944394656903
in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings	pp=4.022499299487662
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences	pp=4.39535986895308
you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin	pp=3.1584238780224023
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so	pp=4.944315217961533
lady catherines great attentions to mrs	pp=1.9370572215204387
collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be as well to be silent	pp=4.660881597280218
only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage	pp=3.818528267305579
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking	pp=3.5842668162731464
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us	pp=3.0765513406624527
we seem to have been designed for each other	pp=2.9070679450719004
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts	pp=4.154673337802938
she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung	pp=3.898836859758538
poor charlotteit was melancholy to leave her to such societybut she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion	pp=4.318904622278028
at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready	pp=3.9168061229916957
after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr	pp=2.9096734539704325
collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr and mrs	pp=4.1478192503877205
but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here	pp=3.701221432127422
elizabeth made no objectionthe door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off	pp=3.8801756059589696
good gracious cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first cameand yet how many things have happened  a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh	pp=3.9044115344870347
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr	pp=3.203638240952199
gardiners house where they were to remain a few days	pp=3.6642549910538076
but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation	pp=3.691683839202992
it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurchstreet for the town of  in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr	pp=3.747529686117883
these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a sallad and cucumber	pp=3.6616721827736027
after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice	pp=3.450934103195595
is not this an agreeable surprise	pp=2.230426769518336
and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there	pp=3.4612663395956984
then shewing her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet	pp=2.8804582716696836
i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not	pp=4.9696732193949105
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better	pp=3.7104547400820036
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable	pp=4.735402050151796
besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight	pp=3.7250669614132144
are they indeed	pp=1.995193685498776
cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction	pp=2.851095395963469
good heaven brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton	pp=3.444617512753009
now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to table	pp=3.13731024308848
it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like	pp=3.100500082078702
jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay	pp=3.608771062786083
lydia laughed and said  aye that is just like your formality and discretion	pp=2.829586473265645
you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say	pp=3.899881256221288
i never saw such a long chin in my life	pp=2.8936766136341814
well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it	pp=3.2411458759561733
wickham is safe	pp=2.712346353866165
and mary king is safe added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune	pp=2.95561462551368
she is a great fool for going away if she liked him	pp=3.214536173448238
but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane	pp=3.765919062492935
i am sure there is not on _his_	pp=4.018436413283969
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her	pp=2.766739036869142
who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing	pp=2.489388273961281
elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal  as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys and lydias purchases were seated in it	pp=4.097032469967093
how nicely we are crammed in cried lydia	pp=2.3406928922311807
i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home	pp=4.070221608373321
and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away	pp=3.677209625605879
have you seen any pleasant men	pp=1.9919525431684546
have you had any flirting	pp=1.7351232462734092
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back	pp=4.243429512599569
jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare	pp=2.9071588323560085
she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you cant think	pp=3.969424899014715
she says lizzy had better have taken mr	pp=2.6891960978348406
collins but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it	pp=4.285805942179218
lord how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls	pp=4.511266063593841
kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs	pp=2.956196216910131
forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs	pp=4.297791809451022
forster and me are _such_ friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did	pp=3.778662588622971
we dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a ladyonly think what fun not a soul knew of it but col and mrs	pp=3.570576460834505
lord how i laughed and so did mrs forster	pp=2.653040484970013
i thought i should have died	pp=2.3481445289511336
and _that_ made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter	pp=3.362453175286438
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn	pp=3.542355991626895
elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name	pp=4.6638265962386125
their reception at home was most kind mrs	pp=2.350120014130005
bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr	pp=3.1841448943385973
bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth  i am glad you are come back lizzy	pp=3.0582996886598006
bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other persons was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	pp=4.397585450605039
oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too	pp=4.5183321910187155
and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach	pp=3.60136095391282
and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off  to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures	pp=3.888492197403895
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds	pp=2.8248315472167382
but i confess they would have no charms for _me_	pp=2.9743107710816754
i should infinitely prefer a book	pp=1.9714366382808775
but of this answer lydia heard not a word	pp=2.2482577114901456
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all	pp=3.3407598919610075
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme	pp=3.95211750136877
it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers	pp=4.937723385298004
there was another reason too for her opposition	pp=2.3340311595962344
the comfort to _her_ of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression	pp=2.9743660281522755
in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account	pp=3.9909631146504925
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents	pp=4.4308565960087805
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last chapter xvii	pp=4.086209168572107
elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr	pp=4.697829439856045
darcy and herself	pp=2.36774095610776
miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings	pp=3.3624603093688585
darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him	pp=3.5426690426584675
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment	pp=3.508985140709425
you do not blame me however for refusing him	pp=3.6409213309965507
blame you oh no	pp=1.4066505265827085
but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham	pp=2.79346678513112
noi do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did	pp=4.263659897748747
but you _will_ know it when i have told you what happened the very next day	pp=3.3043449905437345
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham	pp=4.488664553743257
nor was darcys vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery	pp=3.475546831800458
this will not do said elizabeth	pp=2.4862951672005686
you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing	pp=3.4778035441362736
take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one	pp=4.086307983114074
there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much	pp=4.195787971433694
for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr	pp=3.1933224524992636
darcys but you shall do as you chuse	pp=2.3450420283439763
it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane	pp=3.00632388333537
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she	pp=5.0293969705891595
and poor mr	pp=1.5718086803741371
darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered	pp=2.739942127111315
such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing	pp=4.045487839908044
i am sure you must feel it so	pp=3.2855811863411253
oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both	pp=3.173997660947959
i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent	pp=3.914657595401455
your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather	pp=3.8534783239751884
poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner	pp=3.550550470011611
one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it	pp=3.343874210531308
i never thought mr	pp=1.4001274456948924
and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason	pp=3.630170406933517
it is such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind	pp=3.621458589131607
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty	pp=3.6354101614291157
lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now	pp=3.9776126902018234
indeed i could not	pp=1.4042237315119694
i was uncomfortable enough	pp=1.4117231815416502
i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy	pp=2.942968040631686
darcy for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved certainly	pp=2.5106312202361365
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging	pp=3.6191192593197905
there is one point on which i want your advice	pp=3.2997011125780364
i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickhams character	pp=4.352111276393811
miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully	pp=3.248308707726229
what is your own opinion	pp=2.2859770865952975
that it ought not to be attempted mr	pp=3.2312500826302983
darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public	pp=3.081731765583607
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me	pp=4.691223448589375
the general prejudice against mr	pp=1.7256811489797328
darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light	pp=3.729175648061846
wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is	pp=3.6250927600634744
sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before	pp=3.8282150522085483
at present i will say nothing about it	pp=2.4105053405086427
you are quite right	pp=1.679617428985415
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever	pp=2.886993177442413
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to reestablish a character	pp=2.9618921667198848
we must not make him desperate	pp=2.9057026237540797
the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation	pp=2.793763756484933
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either	pp=3.5768103562641054
but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure	pp=3.2812343712899406
she dared not relate the other half of mr	pp=2.9525842436820926
darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend	pp=4.232728516792071
here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery	pp=3.945485354921941
and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself	pp=4.003099772199019
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value  she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits	pp=4.44804728257055
jane was not happy	pp=1.4130375923710021
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley	pp=2.4715668787166845
having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity	pp=4.352721535823366
well lizzy said mrs	pp=1.4094532957550097
bennet one day what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of janes	pp=3.3436719302020945
i told my sister philips so the other day	pp=2.4638969181663852
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london	pp=3.628477088707981
well he is a very undeserving young manand i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now	pp=4.649689977447658
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know	pp=4.470216867260171
i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more	pp=3.9320671633775404
oh well it is just as he chooses	pp=2.7729421042064546
nobody wants him to come	pp=1.9463988779746604
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it	pp=4.716346147398205
well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done	pp=3.9084050438600175
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer	pp=3.4595348375340405
well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they	pp=3.1198606544147265
well well i only hope it will last	pp=2.6950084817470232
and what sort of table do they keep	pp=2.574130269345375
charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say	pp=2.3540130010845717
if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough	pp=3.3108247384953606
there is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping i dare say	pp=3.044633376240906
no nothing at all	pp=1.407905900858208
a great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes	pp=3.4250138409376865
_they_ will take care not to outrun their income	pp=2.7621639755208682
_they_ will never be distressed for money	pp=2.40510242432283
well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead	pp=3.278407359409799
it was a subject which they could not mention before me no	pp=4.223363777663812
it would have been strange if they had	pp=3.088673491371177
but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves	pp=2.734641551626446
well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better	pp=3.368461897787393
_i_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me chapter xviii	pp=3.2455949589935194
the first week of their return was soon gone	pp=2.4486607329323435
the second began	pp=2.8722882997512897
it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace	pp=4.841079098884082
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments	pp=3.37582220592924
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hardheartedness in any of the family	pp=3.86417919575671
good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe	pp=3.3314209865561017
how can you be smiling so lizzy	pp=2.5218358067538142
their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago	pp=3.7328002140485594
i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millars regiment went away	pp=3.949777914260299
i thought i should have broke my heart	pp=2.6708304069357762
i am sure i shall break _mine_ said lydia	pp=2.9071862182582353
if one could but go to brighton observed mrs bennet	pp=2.216425717914396
oh yesif one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable	pp=2.5031620365375753
a little seabathing would set me up for ever	pp=2.488128571861437
and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good added kitty	pp=3.6158498347635954
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame	pp=3.342150080584034
she felt anew the justice of mr	pp=2.441653464113416
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs	pp=3.0559370528090213
forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton	pp=3.223592890938159
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their _three_ months acquaintance they had been intimate _two_	pp=4.090944169036134
the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs	pp=2.892099211763409
forster the delight of mrs	pp=1.9397862043849292
bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described	pp=3.013632307319088
wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every ones congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	pp=3.646192408132676
i cannot see why mrs	pp=1.990484399867915
forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia said she though i am _not_ her particular friend	pp=3.9183140158605045
i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older	pp=3.7464293487133444
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned	pp=4.037230128543737
as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the deathwarrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go	pp=4.308127928662605
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs	pp=3.858176133200549
forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home	pp=3.965399365107043
he heard her attentively and then said  lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances	pp=4.12173490066532
already arisen repeated mr bennet	pp=1.7246213355088844
what has she frightened away some of your lovers	pp=2.665133122910458
poor little lizzy but do not be cast down	pp=3.1589437119366304
come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly	pp=3.3291572787118935
indeed you are mistaken	pp=1.1246387810564238
i have no such injuries to resent	pp=2.9561782726480765
it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining	pp=3.9919554077451673
our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character	pp=3.871635778760355
excuse mefor i must speak plainly	pp=2.2391074922373075
if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment	pp=4.388626745747963
a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite	pp=3.600815410411708
in this danger kitty is also comprehended	pp=2.19585576829339
she will follow wherever lydia leads	pp=1.9973613930768066
vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace mr	pp=4.48232924164481
bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply  do not make yourself uneasy my love	pp=3.7952858162829637
wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple ofor i may say three very silly sisters	pp=4.332956599662472
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton	pp=3.302047126683354
colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body	pp=3.715531030114448
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here	pp=3.654951168062732
the officers will find women better worth their notice	pp=2.5103416675575723
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry	pp=3.5368991052593466
it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them	pp=3.3377269482876852
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility	pp=3.6028078562058883
she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers	pp=3.0417888369164543
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown	pp=3.6238153387207928
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations	pp=3.6620488654517356
they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same	pp=3.5831515066788486
lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself	pp=3.8373010508168597
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving home	pp=3.5485772897823815
wickham for the last time	pp=2.1575339002647564
having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so	pp=3.353703599044535
she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary	pp=3.3857453125333294
in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her	pp=3.836943764106281
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	pp=4.191056561220065
darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	pp=3.706714859404713
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man asked her how she had liked him	pp=4.48773286848902
nearly three weeks	pp=1.5870717643381975
and you saw him frequently	pp=1.9719807611611502
yes almost every day	pp=1.4128804806546147
his manners are very different from his cousins	pp=3.009779140744802
yes very different	pp=2.2866435551969118
but i think mr	pp=1.832743430081628
darcy improves on acquaintance	pp=1.4131631758307601
indeed cried wickham with a look which did not escape her	pp=3.396623909243965
and pray may i ask	pp=1.7181694579410638
but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves	pp=3.2002515116955754
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style	pp=2.85585144122475
for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials	pp=3.8142697781139594
while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning	pp=3.5021741015871983
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added  when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood	pp=4.163351152882198
wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents  you who so well know my feelings towards mr	pp=3.762623664746302
darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right	pp=3.6895210623642165
his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by	pp=3.7581834905372404
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe	pp=3.9388412772017976
his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart	pp=4.484333295132809
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head	pp=3.096422458620839
the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again	pp=3.9052801128635406
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs	pp=2.4942427693894387
kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy mrs	pp=3.226494049253525
had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort	pp=4.104218398239233
her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her	pp=3.835785671092327
respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown but mr	pp=3.1085892601511835
bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice	pp=4.023840705762665
he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments	pp=3.1536464982048735
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement	pp=3.775447438198651
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given	pp=4.142570309854518
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband	pp=3.5479512264040816
she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible	pp=4.1819802498522805
but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so illjudged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	pp=3.8050163383867988
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment	pp=3.481032897747402
their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp	pp=3.980219365327113
upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself	pp=4.484878836654744
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment	pp=3.978290242980119
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	pp=4.289328227411905
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for	pp=4.303042280083208
were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain	pp=2.6153919379782478
but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized	pp=3.4989985833401582
a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation	pp=3.6083706139026637
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short	pp=3.520033467294635
those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs	pp=4.8469564604719
forster called her and they were going to the campand from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learntfor her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public	pp=4.0805813746541055
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose mrs	pp=3.8147698267299224
bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the waroffice another regiment should be quartered in meryton	pp=3.991280653054771
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs	pp=3.5205535774288745
gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent mr	pp=2.7718597612650067
in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs	pp=4.091463353111675
gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction	pp=2.1899034805131143
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak	pp=4.295560217933687
elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough	pp=3.5251732945382415
but it was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again	pp=3.701643019141649
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected	pp=2.986040062275881
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner	pp=3.8833243509951147
but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me	pp=3.481053980980035
the period of expectation was now doubled	pp=2.410962664821779
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival	pp=3.1209196966564017
gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn	pp=2.71494927783568
the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every wayteaching them playing with them and loving them	pp=3.9115759171558304
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement	pp=4.071309266900285
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenelworth birmingham c	pp=4.703400552823974
are sufficiently known	pp=1.5859987826054056

to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs	pp=2.504534401314679
gardiners former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated	pp=3.685377231972604
it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it	pp=3.81414685557299
in talking over their route the evening before mrs	pp=2.9790615356962156
gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again mr	pp=2.7670912353924986
gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation	pp=3.482243417294447
my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much	pp=3.944752888443193
said her aunt	pp=1.9992321896588194
a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected	pp=3.089236271382327
wickham passed all his youth there you know	pp=2.3420003250521977
elizabeth was distressed	pp=5.861736875759879
she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it	pp=4.315696729863443
she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains mrs	pp=3.7640274756093723
gardiner abused her stupidity	pp=1.414133563692621
if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful	pp=4.621048449256348
they have some of the finest woods in the country	pp=3.215944703471471
elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce	pp=2.4753652404145217
darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred	pp=2.1504363303851597
a most welcome negative followed the last questionand her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme	pp=4.735490820998896
to pemberley therefore they were to go	pp=2.2968592507218437

elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter	pp=3.95419532276688
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground	pp=2.6603638738012503
they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent	pp=3.597545802110225
elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view	pp=3.2200201538502498
they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound	pp=3.482959145524988
it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hillsand in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance	pp=3.7443446504725406
its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned	pp=2.37558601376448
elizabeth was delighted	pp=5.832953846536751
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste	pp=4.094805508225334
they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something  they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned	pp=4.199022268568523
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken	pp=2.3106436994092823
on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was	pp=3.7631209350293076
the housekeeper came a respectablelooking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her	pp=3.5269910226000603
they followed her into the diningparlour	pp=2.3457054420280428
it was a large wellproportioned room handsomely fitted up	pp=3.1508576095921246
elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect	pp=2.9128483759850967
the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object	pp=3.1672615189158675
every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight	pp=3.8910420612530694
the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings	pp=3.788425792286524
this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something like regret	pp=2.7510167005675297
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it	pp=3.5711254850903535
at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs	pp=3.787030931192565
reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with a large party of friends	pp=3.918370946994695
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day  her aunt now called her to look at a picture	pp=3.452829083017127
she approached and saw the likeness of mr	pp=2.2733921544802853
wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantlepiece	pp=2.4724230066757573
her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it	pp=2.4583695347360446
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought up by him at his own expencehe is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild mrs	pp=4.681892081614351
and that said mrs	pp=1.408107596863636
reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my masterand very like him	pp=2.812330517810805
reynoldss respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master	pp=3.0558189118433847
does that young lady know mr darcy	pp=2.4157641225659554
elizabeth coloured and saida little	pp=1.9960763942759714
and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam	pp=4.179800191927493
i am sure _i_ know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this	pp=3.90119005081783
this room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then	pp=3.437759043733889
he was very fond of them	pp=2.5622013817734204
this accounted to elizabeth for mr	pp=2.19851646164731
reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old	pp=3.9544125143080286
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mr gardiner	pp=3.167717176681094
oh yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplishedshe plays and sings all day long	pp=3.0164059269362933
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master she comes here tomorrow with him mr	pp=3.397974134570088
gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs	pp=3.1047942240982844
reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister	pp=3.6686573039279464
is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year	pp=2.4858115439541755
not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months	pp=4.156753286402156
except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate	pp=2.6416236221456253
if your master would marry you might see more of him	pp=2.669473304949455
yes sir but i do not know when _that_ will be	pp=3.079909791042606
elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so	pp=5.740958139533853
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old	pp=3.7996834743274737
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas	pp=2.7577747189370228
her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying  there are very few people of whom so much can be said	pp=3.7126714499375773
you are lucky in having such a master	pp=2.5323931118149394
if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better	pp=4.171007448069842
but i have always observed that they who are goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up and he was always the sweetesttempered most generoushearted boy in the world	pp=4.407210767762978
elizabeth almost stared at hercan this be mr	pp=2.3377049539561945
darcy thought she	pp=1.5688098184887236
his father was an excellent man said mrs gardiner	pp=2.697436412390451
yes maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like himjust as affable to the poor	pp=3.745795068352283
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more mrs	pp=2.740451374101686
reynolds could interest her on no other point	pp=2.330632149958283
she related the subject of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain mr	pp=3.303124696842945
gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase	pp=4.020935206319529
he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived	pp=3.6324013587384107
not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but themselves	pp=3.2326674995650797
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name	pp=4.1237931881526775
some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it	pp=4.3808247184665134
to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men	pp=3.8293974682281013
in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth	pp=2.717759380472927
this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend	pp=3.8717628315781383
that is not very likely our authority was too good	pp=3.0482969760413856
on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very pretty sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley	pp=4.352382069253198
he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows mrs	pp=3.9633433929939605
reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter the room	pp=2.6785836311695412
and this is always the way with him she addedwhatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment	pp=3.695297695760488
there is nothing he would not do for her	pp=3.4656363953336173
the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were all that remained to be shewn	pp=3.399006080661384
in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible	pp=4.008098262551124
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her	pp=3.517509855480704
darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her	pp=3.2429159841882043
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery mrs	pp=3.3468951599650762
reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers life time	pp=3.2728203301917977
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs	pp=2.166053527891544
reynolds was of no trifling nature	pp=1.9943758435400412
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant	pp=2.7462574389999843
as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianshiphow much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestowhow much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression	pp=4.296983887437686
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door	pp=3.7973502477095984
as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables	pp=4.1761824232018405
their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush	pp=3.037921457660594
he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility	pp=3.888884831924144
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome	pp=3.401868511365459
had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr	pp=3.37046361289145
darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it	pp=2.960175309475638
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life	pp=4.2438949758249285
nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts	pp=4.071129640057589
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave	pp=3.446978732241229
the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence	pp=3.546965350383079
she was overpowered by shame and vexation	pp=2.1394987627342292
her coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged thing in the world how strange must it appear to him in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come	pp=3.921114976211748
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected	pp=3.1010066665905924
had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage	pp=4.196087788210282
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting	pp=2.9412326522969714
and his behaviour so strikingly alteredwhat could it mean	pp=2.4907399387964206
that he should even speak to her was amazingbut to speak with such civility to enquire after her family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting	pp=4.082786975414259
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think nor how to account for it	pp=3.5837833156058974
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene	pp=4.205386537107357
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr	pp=3.6148561081409327
darcy then was	pp=1.9392469624150477
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him	pp=4.914437046066219
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure	pp=3.942097510882874
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself	pp=3.677643671347439
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream mr	pp=4.1526377976137425
gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk	pp=3.7627100797653528
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round	pp=3.8390626796057976
it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts	pp=3.8826562956441926
they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it	pp=3.95231222051299
her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr	pp=3.6305360308161023
gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little	pp=3.6650972634690286
darcy approaching them and at no great distance	pp=2.3150228037061313
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met	pp=3.650925704529659
elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them	pp=3.7766022635567427
for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path	pp=4.3207262204060255
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them	pp=3.204075351226442
her colour changed and she said no more mrs	pp=2.6740112583621105
gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	pp=3.540470117559489
what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion	pp=3.3063421776586503
the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions	pp=4.185313276254231
that he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardiner	pp=3.8331087223454006
elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph	pp=3.6203413620969824
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush	pp=4.384274986817966
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners	pp=3.6445242065653964
darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport mrs	pp=4.290805760322184
gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder	pp=3.461154081064813
elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself	pp=3.058318304685286
her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered	pp=3.086347370351023
from what can it proceed	pp=1.7208166910779945
it cannot be for _me_ it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened	pp=3.5434320055884303
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this	pp=2.774995348429018
it is impossible that he should still love me	pp=3.5486888980876063
after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration	pp=4.458468092552736
it originated in mrs	pp=1.4081190587831893
gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands mr	pp=3.2772324539450763
darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together	pp=3.4311029913001785
after a short silence the lady first spoke	pp=2.4659545551136133
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till tomorrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country	pp=4.6121798676242385
he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling	pp=4.178037750008281
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow	pp=2.0587376712134557
bingleys name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion _his_ mind was not very differently engaged	pp=4.0312370920328
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to youwill you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton	pp=3.742225516276563
the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it	pp=4.150560049138424
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her	pp=4.117120828127951
they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought	pp=2.508042048916486
elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased	pp=3.435525538786427
his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind	pp=3.7321691337299803
gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind	pp=2.918689621178636
he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn	pp=3.1155403448167114
at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward	pp=3.684080443828498
she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject	pp=3.1954043322858587
at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance	pp=4.037597545346437
yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the têteàtête was over on mr and mrs	pp=3.3535868001600044
gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness mr	pp=4.104134431706904
darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house	pp=3.446456077142734
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle	pp=2.6673248200469457
i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud _i_ have seen nothing of it	pp=3.2984795333838695
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us	pp=2.936933072632531
it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention	pp=4.090972471224286
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling	pp=2.5367857848920634
to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features are perfectly good	pp=4.410476211419898
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle	pp=3.43722870898371
your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds	pp=3.936951953248647
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing	pp=3.499331908649475
gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham	pp=3.658258105798656
he has not an illnatured look	pp=2.3813811556499607
but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes	pp=3.7296539320311237
but he is a liberal master i suppose and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue	pp=3.7128613869005522
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire	pp=4.486622960354084
fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance	pp=4.027960482835825
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr	pp=3.6939263022912088
darcys civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister chapter ii	pp=3.4727336225640815
elizabeth had settled it that mr	pp=2.1676017222737585
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street	pp=4.208343431028435
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected	pp=3.304134548851221
her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business	pp=3.82620799859619
nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece	pp=3.922149089159546
while these newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was every moment increasing	pp=2.9226867875773994
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse	pp=3.7638967425382686
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place	pp=2.990448296593175
with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself	pp=3.4176452898860155
since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy	pp=4.331311157199753
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable	pp=2.8778715199626355
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful	pp=3.6072183371011035
she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle	pp=3.8707729452927544
elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr	pp=3.223389704951452
darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings	pp=3.0268233367191733
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room	pp=4.782589214664526
all elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again	pp=3.760337199119772
gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself	pp=2.6719542017083144
they had long wished to see him	pp=2.363185469359216
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr	pp=2.305406927081101
darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love	pp=4.148931850658008
of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough	pp=3.272123347792909
elizabeth on her side had much to do	pp=2.6315982636353645
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	pp=4.5615926927771
bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased	pp=2.7249217445124336
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner	pp=4.136770368844773
sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance	pp=3.723995613378833
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard	pp=3.0707653800226447
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister	pp=2.7192227767106676
on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared	pp=4.1169118207055515
he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months	pp=4.606704017853028
we have not met since the <NUM>th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield	pp=3.394837631530066
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn	pp=3.7258355194264285
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr	pp=4.890607683343873
darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day	pp=4.138478153901477
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible	pp=4.17173610308993
never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings	pp=3.8077087159680127
their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr	pp=3.5587376463401585
darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs	pp=3.36722026449188
miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed mrs	pp=3.2363319655123903
gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how _she_ whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head	pp=3.9792774324253695
presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on	pp=3.607799363814366
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends	pp=4.0560774360568175
elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little	pp=4.526766959932967
gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication	pp=3.7181125114047124
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr	pp=4.031551898076147
they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry of mr	pp=2.8592699941837965
darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find	pp=4.4866654149445155
there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected	pp=3.6725376913227223
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown where the family did not visit	pp=3.655328731593025
it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	pp=3.436556057947066
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr	pp=4.585207817624661
darcy afterwards discharged	pp=1.5871873909566696
as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out	pp=4.259192056726025
no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called	pp=3.9879544366312056
but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked	pp=4.032493281671076
it was gratitudegratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection	pp=3.733785631162597
he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister	pp=3.979929525247376
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning	pp=4.540687696506574
they were therefore to goelizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply mr	pp=3.2207364513950427
gardiner left them soon after breakfast	pp=1.993437511457344
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon chapter iii	pp=3.7537569474931036
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed	pp=4.101393654610208
on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer	pp=3.8385839600217437
its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn	pp=3.694556758374269
hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london	pp=3.2239007916519733
georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs	pp=3.873222706066846
gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her by mrs	pp=2.812854558981161
hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments	pp=3.7355583646544512
it was first broken by mrs	pp=1.9787902003558315
gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on	pp=2.6640978710259593
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard	pp=4.292008636671043
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention	pp=4.8247082223788365
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much	pp=4.3387390485905515
her own thoughts were employing her	pp=1.9579350702300367
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room	pp=3.1334076241000988
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family	pp=3.2473743866790903
she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more	pp=3.1331820412824185
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs	pp=3.898688106647808
annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post	pp=3.939038301143948
there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table	pp=3.9125212445147146
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr	pp=3.3381368775669773
darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came	pp=4.23548680410064
he had been some time with mr	pp=3.2304787323608912
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrasseda resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room	pp=3.8056392119551363
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr	pp=4.015600932647731
darcy were by no means over	pp=2.8372995234382685
miss darcy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side	pp=4.314764441272233
miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility  pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton	pp=3.928579794998381
they must be a great loss to _your_ family	pp=3.037058395768515
in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	pp=4.178481451254091
while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes	pp=3.635925022606945
to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own	pp=4.023387524620044
he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend	pp=3.904116659929198
elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more	pp=3.899331685619604
her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully	pp=3.8103765894525563
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer abovementioned and while mr	pp=3.1956662080430274
but georgiana would not join her	pp=1.958446311450865
her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable	pp=4.067896019963035
how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr	pp=2.500557397095818
darcy she cried i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter	pp=2.8742245749353748
she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again	pp=4.006470483106025
however little mr	pp=2.225520539746829
darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tannedno miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer	pp=3.528898534375763
her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome	pp=3.187588142094124
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected	pp=4.210334909692362
he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued  i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield _she_ a beautyi should as soon call her mother a wit	pp=4.208009324971635
but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time	pp=3.3432124746360325
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but _that_ was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance	pp=3.966091725249222
he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself mrs	pp=4.850499055139517
gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both	pp=3.274007063895452
gardiner thought of him and mrs	pp=2.320605167199662
gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject chapter iv	pp=3.6301449553263656
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere	pp=4.3145992235980035
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves	pp=3.6284800987844847
the one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago	pp=3.292805938439508
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence	pp=3.6782815686552066
it was to this effect  since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all well	pp=4.466899289684074
what i have to say relates to poor lydia	pp=2.7179562023737334
an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickhamimagine our surprise	pp=4.237429592409619
i am very very sorry	pp=2.5895832834746444
so imprudent a match on both sidesbut i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood	pp=3.298364712956442
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart	pp=3.20203495509033
his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing	pp=3.1563474590042184
our poor mother is sadly grieved	pp=2.2353878147437105
my father bears it better	pp=1.7143276437089827
how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves	pp=3.437078418010564
they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight	pp=3.169050641680719
the express was sent off directly	pp=1.6527905143345678
my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us	pp=3.382378102299915
lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention	pp=3.0977401556242823
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written	pp=5.050040944489812
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first	pp=4.08126443218202
by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent	pp=3.9452281129872775
imprudent as a marriage between mr	pp=1.9845158228045534
wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland	pp=3.8466452945322582
colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express	pp=3.5364795085864826
though lydias short letter to mrs f	pp=2.3799388122650185
gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w	pp=3.678760781600002
who instantly taking the alarm set off from b	pp=2.4660607815339084
he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackneycoach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom	pp=3.3451531080424624
all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road	pp=3.838617894800164
i know not what to think	pp=2.3782131624032536
after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f	pp=2.710691131046747
came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through	pp=3.7179774735716786
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart	pp=3.7601550535692607
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f	pp=2.453633598952072
our distress my dear lizzy is very great	pp=2.897705306880038
my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him	pp=2.9945401085995917
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thingimpossible	pp=3.799425600339703
i grieve to find however that colonel f	pp=2.3542677134273946
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w	pp=3.6537819882045373
was not a man to be trusted	pp=2.700287655488822
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room	pp=2.7433020423449155
could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected	pp=3.931680807721103
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder	pp=4.525309697619524
i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return	pp=4.163533567389989
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former	pp=3.8580379895509695
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her	pp=3.3196264611965174
what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again tomorrow evening	pp=4.499303089292828
in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness	pp=3.7812659680703025
oh where where is my uncle	pp=1.9812619136996448
cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared	pp=3.674956567982287
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you	pp=3.701239533833311
i must find mr	pp=1.4000269139233248
gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose	pp=3.3838911698301204
good god what is the matter	pp=1.9495983492008373
cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner	pp=3.9605908616325673
elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them	pp=3.4213752319079265
calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly	pp=3.4610684759859787
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid	pp=4.213395654716284
is there nothing you could take to give you present reliefa glass of wineshall i get you oneyou are very ill	pp=3.3559082408200487
there is nothing the matter with me	pp=2.24363668362245
i am quite well	pp=2.1837973683049636
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word	pp=3.759311700483508
i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news	pp=3.4269049089136243
it cannot be concealed from any one	pp=2.8252121018120127
my youngest sister has left all her friendshas elopedhas thrown herself into the power ofof mr wickham	pp=3.0689956186598897
they are gone off together from brighton	pp=2.4230547476317548
_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest	pp=2.9763300930008127
she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever	pp=3.1704024751566156
darcy was fixed in astonishment	pp=1.7119805749779684
when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that _i_ might have prevented it_i_ who knew what he was	pp=3.3739139576855957
had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened	pp=3.9623798895035556
but it is all all too late now	pp=3.7483461033695393
i am grieved indeed cried darcy grievedshocked	pp=2.2026283471015207
but is it certain absolutely certain	pp=1.9978563732218149
oh yesthey left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland	pp=3.141378647152132
and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her	pp=3.470620973257374
my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour	pp=4.029557798968024
but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done	pp=2.6631447425354464
how is such a man to be worked on	pp=3.4160122925358274
how are they even to be discovered	pp=2.142505218437542
it is every way horrible  darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence	pp=2.9323425059135557
when _my_ eyes were opened to his real characteroh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew noti was afraid of doing too much	pp=3.7740521957398596
wretched wretched mistake  darcy made no answer	pp=1.9280711858151165
elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it	pp=2.1321759037381613
her power was sinking every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace	pp=3.480922216480371
she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress	pp=3.298075947695792
but self though it would intrude could not engross her	pp=2.576893233514572
lydiathe humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern	pp=4.270404646601527
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distressbut i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks	pp=3.7614764256089184
this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley today oh yes	pp=3.596371026227613
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy	pp=2.7798348954982015
say that urgent business calls us home immediately	pp=2.3731236285330115
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possiblei know it cannot be long	pp=3.669708543972796
he readily assured her of his secrecyagain expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away	pp=3.6067226989913137
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination	pp=4.527747659237005
but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its illsuccess might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment	pp=4.01844595740899
be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business	pp=3.7445154442689987
never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her	pp=3.0238980032367855
no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation	pp=3.4570344215347353
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement	pp=3.6624593137036037
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible	pp=4.189776232284873
but now it was all too natural	pp=2.9948565143286574
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body	pp=4.136140392559777
sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion	pp=3.183434175595172
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh how acutely did she now feel it	pp=3.0995588132855536
she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe mr and mrs	pp=3.933175013904013
gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly illbut satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energythough lydia had never been a favourite with them mr and mrs	pp=3.986781055801126
gardiner could not but be deeply affected	pp=2.8191599892273467
not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr	pp=3.3446430132751757
they were to be off as soon as possible	pp=4.421566566735884
john told us mr	pp=1.3993994870980084
darcy was here when you sent for uswas it so	pp=2.5810398003117196
yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement	pp=3.89754434821788
that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare	pp=3.143808657324358
an hour however saw the whole completed and mr	pp=2.4168336789460834
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn chapter v	pp=4.1953746086908215
i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter	pp=4.197927055915132
it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best	pp=3.969048168822607
could he expect that her friends would not step forward	pp=2.583232832430301
his temptation is not adequate to the risk	pp=2.272920176828308
cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment	pp=2.1677483720477175
upon my word said mrs	pp=2.0540953646183646
gardiner i begin to be of your uncles opinion	pp=2.9198604520283307
it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it	pp=3.915382459487718
i cannot think so very ill of wickham	pp=2.3428409852080434
can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it	pp=2.8553055606049433
not perhaps of neglecting his own interest	pp=2.186491745350756
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable	pp=2.60534671184741
if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it	pp=3.982721259072527
why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case	pp=3.357475993662377
in the first place replied mr	pp=2.1249686840421242
oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road	pp=3.8511043772909717
they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose	pp=3.3679482580939633
but why all this secrecy	pp=2.162559186779492
why any fear of detection	pp=1.9552547242798954
why must their marriage be private	pp=1.9866862807453538
oh no no this is not likely	pp=2.8162902234449456
his most particular friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her	pp=3.319241625268122
wickham will never marry a woman without some money	pp=2.4900460389882
he cannot afford it	pp=1.3886797162964277
and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well	pp=3.5570045554690304
as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce	pp=4.591286816951717
but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good	pp=3.6565940623307864
lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that _he_ would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter	pp=3.7184242480869005
but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage	pp=3.7427063182539384
it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt	pp=4.24089086374754
but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity	pp=4.211722933321212
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way	pp=4.116596298015461
susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough	pp=2.6961937229774233
but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt	pp=3.3901237907902995
of whom does jane ever think ill	pp=2.199323052722027
and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them	pp=3.948095777619686
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word	pp=3.908575423258863
that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating	pp=3.7562487653757026
and do you really know all this cried mrs	pp=2.819906434616821
i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring	pp=2.236564134410977
i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr	pp=3.3852002161891925
darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him	pp=4.069194317921985
and there are other circumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless	pp=4.538030352372429
from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl	pp=3.7019035225449044
yet he knew to the contrary himself	pp=2.112165419808217
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her	pp=4.325947988431937
but does lydia know nothing of this	pp=2.384085292466739
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand	pp=3.550272846792065
oh yesthat that is the worst of all	pp=2.9508781310565504
darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself	pp=3.406398817357795
as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown	pp=4.156605098323952
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs	pp=3.2545455431807664
forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me	pp=3.673226481006109
that such a consequence as _this_ should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts	pp=3.4183294439029166
when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other	pp=3.4750240627577837
not the slightest	pp=4.638493018795069
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away	pp=4.037873034181726
when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were	pp=3.8118929895120406
every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites	pp=3.870026137184796
it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey	pp=3.4072034981912296
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness	pp=3.225187655348073
they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day	pp=3.367976163204619
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations	pp=4.727157194584666
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	pp=3.825394708319036
elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mothers apartment immediately met her	pp=3.5773776287082475
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives	pp=3.587809931334179
but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well	pp=3.21367685750849
is my father in town	pp=1.7104241735127055
yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word	pp=2.581664850099479
and have you heard from him often	pp=2.572641229638866
we have heard only once	pp=1.9912364698041018
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do	pp=4.212695219996122
and my motherhow is she	pp=1.708220530398645
how are you all	pp=1.4057794911886528
my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken	pp=2.8619809667990816
she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all	pp=2.8252448298285504
she does not yet leave her dressingroom	pp=2.8706426361603903
mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well	pp=2.583296169967987
but youhow are you cried elizabeth	pp=1.9753266355603818
you look pale	pp=2.7129455420979474
how much you must have gone through  her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs	pp=4.496121802340526
gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party	pp=2.7175818618215106
jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears	pp=3.2973541516901084
when they were all in the drawingroom the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give	pp=4.61529636063881
the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage mrs	pp=3.8226835987476946
bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing	pp=4.078341598573768
if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family _this_ would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her	pp=4.558914579513018
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight	pp=2.9313259795761715
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after	pp=5.140152288200777
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am	pp=3.783440067967023
poor dear child and now heres mr	pp=2.1346670501123866
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr	pp=2.4519382114896175
gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr	pp=4.24689396529977
do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain	pp=3.5464089843683917
in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost	pp=3.869909133609243
as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done	pp=4.2502579176771205
oh my dear brother replied mrs	pp=3.0834002025322835
bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for	pp=2.576479838171108
and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married	pp=3.6941483638112063
and above all things keep mr	pp=2.2264630581329894
bennet from fighting	pp=1.587351403476704
tell him what a dreadful state i am inthat i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day	pp=3.8707294626362794
and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses	pp=3.9909367706748227
oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all but mr	pp=3.134465244589684
gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters	pp=4.019037517585681
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that _one_ only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject	pp=4.279416722534573
in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before	pp=4.184623004763641
one came from her books and the other from her toilette	pp=3.0056347610880496
the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty	pp=4.322647180158018
as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table  this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of	pp=3.9311714648930645
but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation	pp=3.40455950684674
then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievablethat one false step involves her in endless ruinthat her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautifuland that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	pp=3.854522428724006
mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them	pp=3.1270302190786294
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy	pp=3.972130672590376
give me farther particulars	pp=1.4138527811616948
what did colonel forster say	pp=1.7390719582376164
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place	pp=3.0768642730415023
they must have seen them together for ever	pp=2.5625980627565563
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm	pp=4.019071200694299
i am so grieved for him	pp=2.574586230798903
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost	pp=2.39184975094336
he _was_ coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey	pp=4.152735854012063
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry	pp=2.4848396492210796
did he know of their intending to go off	pp=2.6258648923533383
had colonel forster seen denny himself	pp=1.995918640122685
yes but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it	pp=3.951540642929106
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from _that_ i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before	pp=4.305485855496215
and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married	pp=3.9003236441309346
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right	pp=4.446935858885334
my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be	pp=3.4928464930908474
kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step	pp=4.473209708944576
she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks	pp=4.229377518275071
no i believe not	pp=1.4020678671854214
does he know his real character	pp=1.9816241219308683
i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did	pp=3.4924160103805773
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant	pp=3.364358435301317
and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false	pp=3.9208817490757584
oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened  perhaps it would have been better replied her sister	pp=3.7624098503638557
but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable	pp=3.2878974890808625
we acted with the best intentions	pp=1.9532787080042728
could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his wife	pp=3.0881512858311098
he brought it with him for us to see	pp=2.9726753874967033
these were the contents  my dear harriet  you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am missed	pp=3.9410657370956086
i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel	pp=4.0178103819113
i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off	pp=3.5797733255328734
what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for laughing	pp=3.9066033195542595
pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight	pp=3.2435672210945374

i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up good bye	pp=3.8247337552886784
your affectionate friend  lydia bennet	pp=1.7372653474933464
oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it	pp=2.431715062656817
what a letter is this to be written at such a moment	pp=3.2545283851776414
but at least it shews that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey	pp=3.807264104367983
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy	pp=3.97623720663892
my poor father how he must have felt it  i never saw any one so shocked	pp=3.444983982391671
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes	pp=3.0718575674516413
my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion  oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day	pp=3.9361011947937983
i do not knowi hope there wasbut to be guarded at such a time is very difficult	pp=4.01432416253426
my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties	pp=5.080398236687855
your attendance upon her has been too much for you	pp=2.9803854173239817
you do not look well	pp=3.009530240250452
oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone	pp=4.035927480521882
kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on	pp=3.4451136173349193
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me	pp=3.81100960943195
she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she _meant_ well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of ones neighbours	pp=3.6002041015381163
assistance is impossible condolence insufferable	pp=1.7409908270692613
let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied	pp=2.659246393130794
he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them	pp=3.6174161021315223
his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham	pp=3.624309586103695
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach	pp=3.727631992882681
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this chapter vi	pp=5.067880720768741
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr	pp=3.598521578538739
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion	pp=3.7906337719857595
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain mr	pp=4.102407965776232
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	pp=3.03686501332565
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr	pp=3.965407700435226
bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel mrs	pp=3.9334569220996607
gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces	pp=3.743365883593553
she shared in their attendance on mrs	pp=2.1832046360088535
bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom	pp=3.076191142245126
their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them	pp=3.560820502645394
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light	pp=3.3890495911626144
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family	pp=3.880359357714911
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness	pp=4.438575290200567
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them mr	pp=4.600560458491755
gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street that mr	pp=4.012225002187064
bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings mr	pp=4.133246624277602
gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it	pp=3.7257332141651314
he added that mr	pp=1.4020766177960962
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon	pp=3.2353205520747528
there was also a postscript to this effect	pp=2.2483683817602875
i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself	pp=4.075254855698216
if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence	pp=3.562872844219952
colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head	pp=4.178505960684563
but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person	pp=3.570336857259743
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years	pp=3.8114725476567344
it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to	pp=4.750619456650619
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected	pp=3.572048168437978
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every mornings impatience	pp=3.414498169229612
through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance	pp=4.267701245512151
but before they heard again from mr	pp=2.1827458502774153
gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr	pp=2.9909348302082694
collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise	pp=3.900289928816177
be assured my dear sir that mrs	pp=2.506429450210285
collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove	pp=3.943363658819776
no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parents mind	pp=3.4714994105849657
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this	pp=4.197329286378952
bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age	pp=4.37555534032116
howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs	pp=3.6472638577816707
collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair	pp=3.4777162096801213
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace	pp=3.835981174460923
i am dear sir c c mr	pp=2.1930427612270886
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living	pp=4.693001524982149
his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them	pp=4.914134609153105
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him	pp=3.6461244330137945
and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount	pp=4.837194796429089
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton	pp=2.9609405824374724
he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable mr	pp=3.474870556457473
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror	pp=3.2344144713811476
this is wholly unexpected	pp=1.4139995232201883
i had not an idea of it mr	pp=3.0673572714347594
gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday	pp=3.7300142616605525
rendered spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brotherinlaws intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit when mrs	pp=3.996133430088723
bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before	pp=3.808098198837371
what is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried	pp=2.675509460421529
sure he will not leave london before he has found them	pp=3.510927138339543
who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away as mrs	pp=3.3575792055746434
gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr	pp=3.945358698748025
bennet came from it	pp=1.3951391984650643
the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn mrs	pp=3.2069948253835143
gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	pp=3.436136420030951
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley	pp=2.924895565681788
bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure	pp=3.0139632465745514
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it	pp=4.153552612719597
it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that	pp=4.178282857123779
who should suffer but myself	pp=1.7245103524262213
human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame	pp=3.942870471997798
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression	pp=2.7497373580485713
it will pass away soon enough	pp=1.992348694810474
do you suppose them to be in london	pp=2.9373412776347085
yes where else can they be so well concealed	pp=2.4928506403990784
and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty	pp=3.232235254363076
she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration	pp=3.421200595499779
then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind	pp=3.4741407242875977
this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i canor perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away	pp=3.8019127432116
i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if _i_ should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia	pp=4.071456167028582
_you_ go to brightoni would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it	pp=3.6979636097315787
no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village	pp=2.957648751600321
balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters	pp=3.3787964272936355
and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner	pp=3.926831531080089
kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry	pp=2.8216030649241794
well well said he do not make yourself unhappy	pp=2.6931869529128942
if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them chapter vii	pp=4.063073528461057
two days after mr	pp=1.4002541844217624
bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask	pp=4.451916145484901
what do you mean hill	pp=2.248293477495148
we have heard nothing from town	pp=2.22874314794958
dear madam cried mrs	pp=1.407917767550719
hill in great astonishment dont you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner	pp=3.21269712365102
away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech	pp=2.8666773596993624
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the librarytheir father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said  if you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards the little copse	pp=4.171580334694709
upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	pp=3.7959507208469527
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out  oh papa what news what news	pp=4.244122227501419
have you heard from my uncle	pp=2.1372196023972325
well and what news does it bring	pp=2.187370613041381
good or bad	pp=1.3387341328114841
what is there of good to be expected	pp=2.449833494546353
said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it	pp=3.065847121751329
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand	pp=2.16412374928165
read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about	pp=3.348589754570648
gracechurchstreet monday  august <NUM>	pp=1.4134224952024692
my dear brother  at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction	pp=3.8433785458912024
soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were	pp=3.652501757570811
the particulars i reserve till we meet	pp=2.2020373258347146
they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are	pp=4.664798567185377
all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum	pp=4.057305426747327
these are conditions which considering every thing i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you	pp=3.891623409725148
i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer	pp=3.4657360225182696
you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr	pp=2.478625984169376
wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be	pp=3.1439505983492624
the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune	pp=3.9877459880040806
if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement	pp=3.951949182219927
send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly	pp=3.538412495072412
she comes to us today	pp=1.7389836859888033
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on yours c edw gardiner	pp=3.8067956228068085
is it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished	pp=2.0420639430647274
wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister	pp=3.3817252502113124
my dear father i congratulate you	pp=2.4014487419437036
and have you answered the letter said elizabeth	pp=2.7477075389122816
no but it must be done soon	pp=2.4502095507563895
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote	pp=2.916731458855215
oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately	pp=3.292002762271815
consider how important every moment is in such a case	pp=2.8631807657783206
let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself	pp=2.9785549008187227
i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done	pp=2.7980182689552295
and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house	pp=2.6421795421153567
and may i ask	pp=1.4137408181806062
said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with	pp=2.946829996043269
and they _must_ marry yet he is _such_ a man  yes yes they must marry	pp=3.1334719703049085
there is nothing else to be done	pp=3.278398292448494
but there are two things that i want very much to knowone is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him	pp=3.8453128673771295
i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred ayear during my life and fifty after i am gone	pp=3.4680789287554346
his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncles doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself	pp=3.6719643502685666
a small sum could not do all this	pp=2.5519910212581425
no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds	pp=3.5858258212069747
i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship	pp=3.38209284509836
ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid mr	pp=3.23567958312684
bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house	pp=2.7929172036916268
their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroom	pp=3.8019314830748243
and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves	pp=3.8126777278110398
that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia  i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her	pp=4.072812374868265
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced	pp=4.011144052739995
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds	pp=2.3756567738456322
if we are ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr	pp=3.8207569169524684
gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own	pp=2.8261685855967134
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited	pp=4.180614496436991
their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge	pp=3.5277701942960764
by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt  we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy	pp=3.9969847313874522
his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking	pp=3.9251812912062665
their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten	pp=3.7649238075511477
their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget	pp=3.1242884606712336
it is useless to talk of it	pp=2.0905841279922006
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened	pp=3.478570573902507
he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied  just as you please	pp=2.8951109854719244
may we take my uncles letter to read to her	pp=2.523781434238686
take whatever you like and get away	pp=2.337670461203068
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together	pp=3.3296374463643286
bennet could hardly contain herself	pp=1.994281091460506
as soon as jane had read mr	pp=4.096134432362605
gardiners hope of lydias being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance	pp=3.1352531701131165
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation	pp=4.024972924301188
to know that her daughter would be married was enough	pp=3.341350931215448
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	pp=3.1662292629362145
my dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeedshe will be marriedi shall see her againshe will be married at sixteenmy good kind brotheri knew how it would bei knew he would manage every thing	pp=3.7176366696422116
how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly	pp=3.2647443982090825
lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her	pp=3.4013469460802614
stay stay i will go myself	pp=2.3884222620076634
ring the bell kitty for hill	pp=1.9788757894883315
my dear dear lydiahow merry we shall be together when we meet  her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr	pp=4.176794208953812
gardiners behaviour laid them all under	pp=1.982451260846191
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness	pp=3.035817135094926
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr	pp=3.2068758112437745
wickham with money	pp=1.9987235300656265
well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle	pp=3.569136253677746
if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents	pp=4.514319375433597
well i am so happy	pp=1.9845461012054433
in a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs	pp=3.2587241421817588
and she was only sixteen last june	pp=4.062031765490748
my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you write for me	pp=4.757779830939941
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately	pp=3.045613279361832
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted	pp=4.100538035614604
one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual	pp=3.8195135555395083
other schemes too came into her head	pp=2.179459631458129
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips	pp=3.7575786744482507
and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long	pp=3.1411085900979985
kitty run down and order the carriage	pp=2.107168987389464
an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure	pp=2.966200102674743
girls can i do any thing for you in meryton	pp=2.7597692029255527
oh here comes hill	pp=1.4139492240277851
my dear hill have you heard the good news	pp=2.791010707828499
miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding mrs	pp=3.5583006644295856
hill began instantly to express her joy	pp=2.591021264912256
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom	pp=3.711331293393603
poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful	pp=3.87224995970991
she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained chapter viii mr	pp=4.202020445986017
bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him	pp=4.003177867246556
he now wished it more than ever	pp=2.403570864465404
had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her	pp=3.7029986434156306
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place	pp=4.012620852211885
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brotherinlaw and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	pp=3.9655651638768346
bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son	pp=3.757550718096104
this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for	pp=4.348104332652138
five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs	pp=3.4609625622389264
bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he would	pp=3.1760536517110247
this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving mrs	pp=3.6008431937757934
bennet had no turn for economy and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income	pp=3.2346852520894416
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs	pp=2.9606503436016385
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents	pp=3.4225368629223105
this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr	pp=3.4969429362769513
bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him	pp=3.1592675146542306
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him	pp=4.081730187174685
he would scarcely be ten pounds ayear the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands lydias expences had been very little within that sum	pp=3.933003501668722
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible	pp=4.133538647970032
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence	pp=3.60482857597476
his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution	pp=3.257656393824505
the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood	pp=3.2203716001346647
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy	pp=2.8269720442552293
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house	pp=4.507458969613533
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain	pp=3.8128617150944937
it was a fortnight since mrs	pp=3.2486831072742635
bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high	pp=3.6148149034073573
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph	pp=2.547932531561184
the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants	pp=4.013353302692601
hayepark might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawingroom were larger but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful	pp=4.005114486063281
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained	pp=3.128743487935573
but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs	pp=3.445291941192615
bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding	pp=3.2309353402484535
into _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance	pp=2.8673323991886055
i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn	pp=3.6161240089700213
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr	pp=2.3463747270517676
bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs	pp=2.701208189502617
bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter	pp=3.1224672732623038
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion mrs	pp=3.324477099774057
bennet could hardly comprehend it	pp=1.9710340638411596
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible	pp=4.313373308717893
she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place	pp=3.7838340734258535
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr	pp=3.6645663044650547
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means	pp=3.497956091147518
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so much	pp=3.8708809843249297
not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them	pp=3.442087041847227
had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr	pp=3.241354813022115
darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned	pp=3.7431433683306943
the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this	pp=4.001642737030756
she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what	pp=3.0066658301927047
she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it	pp=3.5877915063601775
she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence	pp=3.628512273489805
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet	pp=4.762785323406873
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex	pp=4.260318343828064
but while he was mortal there must be a triumph	pp=3.0950128385179574
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her	pp=3.8739214819631624
his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes	pp=3.2087452000405023
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was	pp=3.0238250023042323
an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family	pp=3.7493016572245277
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine	pp=4.09360623694911
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture mr	pp=3.465383623589401
gardiner soon wrote again to his brother to mr	pp=2.1885947483445976
bennets acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again	pp=4.03060626432207
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr	pp=3.416838322776055
wickham had resolved on quitting the militia	pp=2.319685733926375
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on	pp=4.5605225595630445
and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my nieces	pp=3.6630966582606495
it is mr	pp=4.454038698541894
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north	pp=2.9836146682191544
he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent	pp=3.5246020604173434
i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr	pp=3.0467694177810873
wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself	pp=3.43424048793928
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information	pp=4.001054437330069
he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us	pp=3.5082226845933993
haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week	pp=2.730663209191439
they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs	pp=3.558413789377245
gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south	pp=3.190029243203557
she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her motheryours c e gardiner mr	pp=3.023130357550318
bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as mr	pp=3.11117828037134
gardiner could do but mrs	pp=1.72273292791305
bennet was not so well pleased with it	pp=3.687228230850399
lydias being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites	pp=4.390049570502899
she is so fond of mrs	pp=1.9502213507643715
forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much	pp=3.793916620440221
his daughters request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative	pp=3.831289115049398
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north when mr	pp=4.290417299760135
bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn	pp=4.0417037199030235
elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes chapter ix	pp=4.342003576466435
their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself	pp=3.7081013255460533
the carriage was sent to meet them at  and they were to return in it by dinnertime	pp=3.9669562028922982
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had _she_ been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure they came	pp=3.822016216500655
the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them	pp=3.0705023304518857
smiles decked the face of mrs	pp=2.3336468400207
bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy	pp=3.0004837555327053
her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness	pp=3.3993953710357365
bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial	pp=3.0084224537206854
his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips	pp=2.738113116402914
the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him	pp=4.031222288987928
elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked	pp=2.9282710644639884
lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless	pp=2.589667030831599
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all	pp=4.133074368719637
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man	pp=3.7130702839300507
_she_ blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour	pp=3.3417834198719163
there was no want of discourse	pp=3.3652489260994902
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies	pp=4.0313550530517945
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world	pp=3.788502064015511
nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world	pp=3.9073499299999725
only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time	pp=3.911561007047795
good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was	pp=4.592728453897995
her father lifted up his eyes	pp=1.9795736281671243
jane was distressed	pp=4.062906380477454
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the people here abouts know i am married today	pp=3.5760029887403273
i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing	pp=3.9561854566062524
elizabeth could bear it no longer	pp=1.971894720983197
she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the diningparlour	pp=3.796322567040441
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman	pp=4.18363922648567
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first	pp=4.122763768404538
her ease and good spirits increased	pp=2.2405746190622953
philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs	pp=3.1398602766460755
wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to mrs	pp=3.708994131898951
hill and the two housemaids	pp=2.2948637610469995
well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband	pp=4.1665930687334924
is not he a charming man	pp=2.1913299129868236
i am sure my sisters must all envy me	pp=3.9229191877308613
they must all go to brighton	pp=1.943478081511903
that is the place to get husbands	pp=2.6271724790726663
what a pity it is mamma we did not all go	pp=2.6982696040409087
very true and if i had my will we should	pp=3.2801273227135037
but my dear lydia i dont at all like your going such a way off	pp=3.7133670101587573
must it be so	pp=1.4055765762094552
oh lord yesthere is nothing in that	pp=2.502235891943246
i shall like it of all things	pp=2.340001963642694
you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us	pp=2.8962469705209015
we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all	pp=4.236350623555134
i should like it beyond any thing said her mother	pp=3.275762431900044
and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over	pp=3.724164757504629
i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands	pp=4.188496854819335
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them mr	pp=3.0215887113279596
wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight	pp=3.868096967798502
no one but mrs	pp=1.837485410471264
bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home	pp=3.6019429639365153
these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not	pp=3.6029075972527655
wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydias for him	pp=3.6768154355724905
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion	pp=4.397388801851528
lydia was exceedingly fond of him	pp=1.9450058134112351
he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him	pp=3.768093363988981
he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country	pp=4.473131805141929
you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it	pp=3.3213575291226562
no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject	pp=3.3989581067709325
we were married you know at st	pp=2.1780369352069684
clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish	pp=2.3268056974104847
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven oclock	pp=3.3108611986326024
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church	pp=3.891236959458142
well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted	pp=4.803935472319564
however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham	pp=3.7849859102432033
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat	pp=3.782065749989557
well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them	pp=4.226102003897716
not one party or scheme or any thing	pp=2.35530533392053
well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone	pp=4.087974086340618
and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it	pp=4.020733446694696
well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day	pp=4.332797038631347
but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out	pp=3.4831034826703546
however i recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr	pp=3.5413977638809704
darcy might have done as well mr	pp=2.7878606794127347
darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazement	pp=1.9698503684228523
oh yeshe was to come there with wickham you know	pp=2.9264829657874665
but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it	pp=2.6527174726785474
i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say	pp=2.4987499263817656
it was to be such a secret  if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject	pp=4.335747130653598
you may depend upon my seeking no further	pp=2.1421294875753425
oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions	pp=2.930247096697568
thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry	pp=3.573866437379537
on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away	pp=2.9914564318625945
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information mr	pp=3.8460211524352235
darcy had been at her sisters wedding	pp=2.994108892352022
it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go	pp=3.253230179595355
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none	pp=4.250783220407156
she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended	pp=4.503536489291945
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time	pp=4.076904773822714
pray write instantly and let me understand itunless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance	pp=4.022833815308671
not that i _shall_ though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out	pp=4.174946839349476
janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of ittill it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante chapter x	pp=3.8797794769479177
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could	pp=3.511412534510967
she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial gracechurchstreet sept <NUM>	pp=4.984279969652949
my dear niece  i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you	pp=3.6406034134311094
i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from _you_	pp=3.6024825441234505
dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side	pp=4.148417167623694
if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence	pp=3.3079547472434463
your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done	pp=3.556902941773916
but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit	pp=3.3980370243420963
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor mr	pp=3.496230623358357
darcy called and was shut up with him several hours	pp=2.783761300860743
he came to tell mr	pp=2.2651017474895236
gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr	pp=4.018559706474595
wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once	pp=4.038482532359631
from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them	pp=3.530027586614124
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him	pp=4.203353666755207
his character was to speak for itself	pp=2.4163452254259985
he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself	pp=3.51573410535353
if he _had another_ motive i am sure it would never disgrace him	pp=4.259998831784209
there is a lady it seems a mrs	pp=2.768025136542591
younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what	pp=4.373337426724901
she then took a large house in edwardstreet and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings this mrs	pp=3.21543912823921
younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town	pp=3.7640244392742477
she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found	pp=3.9511060614730886
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her	pp=4.056885930371592
at length however our kind friend procured the wishedfor direction	pp=3.037078435386888
they were in  street	pp=1.9992371907010376
he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia	pp=2.4594557430663673
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was	pp=3.064948331573154
she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham	pp=3.9328263309130813
she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when	pp=4.21625437951986
since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been _his_ design	pp=3.6857202181152044
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on her own folly alone	pp=3.7105765994421094
he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it	pp=3.9145404390459557
darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once though mr	pp=3.6139675942952336
but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country	pp=3.872851696598343
under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief	pp=3.711445478803937
they met several times for there was much to be discussed	pp=2.610771786911495
wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable	pp=3.5148305011238845
every thing being settled between _them_ mr	pp=2.191610038701638
darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurchstreet the evening before i came home but mr	pp=3.827673066975427
gardiner could not be seen and mr	pp=3.647879914284659
darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning	pp=3.368162779281309
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former	pp=4.291076799200886
he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business	pp=4.376741899797138
on saturday he came again	pp=1.7365056814745325
your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together	pp=4.0804879149851185
they met again on sunday and then _i_ saw him too	pp=2.6731838423545415
it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn	pp=4.707252929189498
but our visitor was very obstinate	pp=1.9691681513444366
i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all	pp=2.866366267728795
he has been accused of many faults at different times but _this_ is the true one	pp=3.527120091271317
they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved	pp=3.578011881141558
but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due	pp=4.308657465998515
but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most	pp=2.8725697116402333
his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ and his commission purchased	pp=3.6046348748349635
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above	pp=4.558227539009032
it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was	pp=4.444185375636775
perhaps there was some truth in _this_ though i doubt whether _his_ reserve or _anybodys_ reserve can be answerable for the event	pp=3.346880466015764
but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair	pp=3.9328467192484164
when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish	pp=4.353265173259319
i believe i have now told you every thing	pp=2.4765438284432317
lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house	pp=2.8647070104190844
_he_ was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain	pp=4.464833909427512
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family	pp=4.797240381625256
if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen	pp=4.577300773492569
he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday	pp=3.4022549966715676
his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire	pp=3.58622027234891
his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and _that_ if he marry _prudently_ his wife may teach him	pp=3.4198065603390657
i thought him very slyhe hardly ever mentioned your name	pp=2.6249902014666864
but slyness seems the fashion	pp=1.6854877488771913
pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p	pp=4.215475088896142
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park	pp=3.83091880089775
but i must write no more	pp=2.3850426464578662
the children have been wanting me this half hour	pp=2.5033957114985146
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share	pp=3.759446693604202
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr	pp=2.7594795429190024
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem	pp=3.7237704487906136
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her	pp=3.8886259016373366
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham	pp=4.289271683515498
brotherinlaw of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the connection	pp=2.9068140025483244
he had to be sure done much	pp=3.612489403384824
she was ashamed to think how much	pp=2.0005322621379436
but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief	pp=3.1058422795855174
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned	pp=4.483596056699162
oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him	pp=3.7771124534354836
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself	pp=3.3876841121299215
she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again	pp=2.7982443808256536
she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr	pp=3.7200800243762004
darcy and herself	pp=2.36774095610776
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham	pp=3.458830265440195
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister	pp=3.1665492441696586
said he as he joined her	pp=2.419215629930745
you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome	pp=3.412849163725886
i should be sorry indeed if it were	pp=2.765038159380408
and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley	pp=4.230106722678388
she replied in the affirmative	pp=1.6935738677384462
i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle	pp=4.050131008647254
and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose	pp=2.4809760858647274
poor reynolds she was always very fond of me	pp=2.773686899761973
yes she did	pp=2.2744980742959346
and what did she say	pp=1.7216873693702974
that you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot turned out well	pp=4.340400856685091
at such a distance as _that_ you know things are strangely misrepresented	pp=3.384878175300753
certainly he replied biting his lips	pp=1.9792104087605997
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said  i was surprised to see darcy in town last month	pp=3.2935024465367855
we passed each other several times	pp=1.9965953082392256
i wonder what he can be doing there	pp=2.5607240982769226
perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth	pp=2.9865206698605244
it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year undoubtedly	pp=3.822599153716471
did you see him while you were at lambton	pp=2.4780621660357314
yes he introduced us to his sister	pp=2.135107889914786
and do you like her very much	pp=2.537081397642733
i hope she will turn out well	pp=2.1980374670257237
i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age	pp=3.502958696019532
did you go by the village of kympton	pp=2.4900417461275866
i do not recollect that we did	pp=3.7689517040193703
i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had	pp=3.887120282352272
a most delightful placeexcellent parsonage house it would have suited me in every respect	pp=3.5363046317357716
how should you have liked making sermons exceedingly well	pp=2.7096039729968178
i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing	pp=3.95448199131937
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent	pp=2.8283352517086886
i _have_ heard from authority which i thought _as good_ that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron you have	pp=3.9711852058565924
i _did_ hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly	pp=4.579109390831617
you did and it was not wholly without foundation	pp=3.8028292269597075
you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it	pp=2.959378924660768
they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile  come mr	pp=4.0157244447106075
wickham we are brother and sister you know	pp=2.503947491305042
do not let us quarrel about the past	pp=2.385750834025034
in future i hope we shall be always of one mind	pp=2.8748161440821596
she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house chapter xi mr	pp=3.6967634111082917
wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet	pp=4.718971317471118
the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs	pp=2.8142681750591656
bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth	pp=4.284655186536991
oh lord i dont know	pp=1.7377756118860253
not these two or three years perhaps	pp=2.9516899193352866
write to me very often my dear	pp=2.189817277042215
as often as i can	pp=2.096887211956272
but you know married women have never much time for writing	pp=2.7109202765645097
my sisters may write to _me_	pp=1.9409087278682122
they will have nothing else to do mr	pp=2.2182324038467094
wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes	pp=2.6911123606032907
he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things	pp=2.463924129087303
he is as fine a fellow said mr	pp=2.6766274338402085
bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw	pp=3.362353762879152
he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all	pp=2.539014493416921
i am prodigiously proud of him	pp=1.9372680213627542
the loss of her daughter made mrs	pp=2.6535805034793083
i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends	pp=4.051850437041733
this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth	pp=3.0810892984717126
it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single	pp=2.78965417433444
it is no such thing	pp=1.733193979707966
lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off	pp=3.5716678433685454
if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon	pp=4.418286482119917
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation	pp=3.8572502648101246
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks mrs	pp=3.7350766238006394
bennet was quite in the fidgets	pp=2.1269893847958934
she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns	pp=3.3337434448989756
well well and so mr	pp=2.109301665821002
bingley is coming down sister for mrs	pp=2.1818179048046407
philips first brought her the news	pp=1.9226585768415085
well so much the better	pp=1.3989843039775873
not that i care about it though	pp=2.9349488425417354
he is nothing to us you know and i am sure _i_ never want to see him again	pp=3.8015789025498052
but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it	pp=3.736074096820405
and who knows what _may_ happen	pp=1.9916707465048162
but that is nothing to us	pp=2.3344793955168592
you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it	pp=2.690724679729624
and so is it quite certain he is coming	pp=2.480759079359187
you may depend on it replied the other for mrs	pp=2.9269603309511822
nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true	pp=4.456713905942436
he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday	pp=2.761411346905267
she was going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed	pp=4.024388477112126
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour	pp=5.534538806868117
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said  i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed	pp=4.0804804358512206
but dont imagine it was from any silly cause	pp=2.473777465128917
i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i _should_ be looked at	pp=3.1875872152696076
i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain	pp=2.9860861082692383
i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him	pp=3.450025729565903
not that i am afraid of _myself_ but i dread other peoples remarks	pp=4.418117304023245
elizabeth did not know what to make of it	pp=3.1373017444261313
had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it	pp=4.272424599583729
yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation i _will_ leave him to himself	pp=3.615412937830713
in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it	pp=4.401845103599149
they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them	pp=3.4922901187340103
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again	pp=4.179706180930688
as soon as ever mr	pp=3.0640145123262155
bingley comes my dear said mrs	pp=2.483430599133434
bennet you will wait on him of course no no	pp=2.5729212040244165
you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters	pp=3.475786244455884
but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again	pp=3.908289197909615
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield	pp=3.658510429994471
tis an etiquette i despise said he	pp=2.1624291655334997
if he wants our society let him seek it	pp=2.486994761781312
he knows where we live	pp=1.7370492864716762
i will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again	pp=3.7518740687542556
well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him	pp=3.8719645068747046
but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined	pp=3.0530953523356197
we must have mrs	pp=1.6682589571028756
that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him	pp=3.4932832297980014
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr	pp=3.8891336214706165
bingley in consequence of it before _they_ did	pp=2.9565619420958544
as the day of his arrival drew near  i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister	pp=3.9417393773274547
it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of	pp=5.127056049429438
my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says	pp=4.233704187197468
happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over  i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power	pp=4.034481654850743
you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much mr bingley arrived mrs	pp=3.453422649698428
bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could	pp=4.0672934257667945
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy	pp=2.527388910058721
jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the windowshe lookedshe saw mr	pp=3.4428901995755075
darcy with him and sat down again by her sister	pp=3.4258624391898866
some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know	pp=3.124120571512496
la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before mr	pp=3.2195544343489755
whats his name	pp=1.5868350588493538
that tall proud man	pp=1.4119933474100597
good gracious mr	pp=2.6110033505985073
darcyand so it does i vow	pp=1.9838403274535132
well any friend of mr	pp=1.6756522536344174
bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him	pp=3.673457012953883
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern	pp=2.512839935244944
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter	pp=4.060942588484111
both sisters were uncomfortable enough	pp=1.7384140777443369
each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr	pp=3.6858158234239307
bingleys friend without being heard by either of them	pp=2.455845901766373
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs	pp=4.951582359029328
gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him	pp=2.7194841968388976
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley	pp=4.404401516278494
her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire	pp=3.867070903561554
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken	pp=4.1737925300200365
but she would not be secure	pp=3.221516335661122
let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation	pp=3.387615104831269
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door	pp=3.6453485574443065
jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected	pp=3.410153602436255
on the gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance	pp=3.7099939848449788
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command	pp=3.7194732248313964
she had ventured only one glance at darcy	pp=2.3554572067833544
but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt	pp=3.528405123649742
it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture	pp=3.4525949744684654
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed	pp=3.239574035866287
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend	pp=3.406556770440198
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied	pp=3.860589235462511
darcy after enquiring of her how mr and mrs	pp=2.393082301798667
gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing	pp=3.852980269023318
he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire	pp=4.110226179853588
there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself	pp=3.3670418802466084
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground	pp=3.8093203264122577
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed	pp=2.9769513289297294
could i expect it to be otherwise said she	pp=3.513912356464598
yet why did he come	pp=1.9811431295111772
she enquired after his sister but could do no more	pp=2.5984993299842696
it is a long time mr	pp=3.693938100033431
he readily agreed to it	pp=1.66565558549526
i began to be afraid you would never come back again	pp=3.2750850917070298
people _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true	pp=4.064755854219375
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away	pp=3.5184281983279404
miss lucas is married and settled	pp=1.9431564712782903
and one of my own daughters	pp=3.659094402124022
it was only said lately george wickham esq	pp=2.7951544459171083
to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing	pp=3.520403804520358
it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it	pp=3.475888642755204
bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations	pp=3.302428574529562
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes how mr	pp=2.3740580555355937
darcy looked therefore she could not tell	pp=2.940687523050103
it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr	pp=4.778866063992658
bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me	pp=3.5350395154697125
they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long	pp=3.611687219555303
his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars	pp=4.082512261572651
thank heaven he has _some_ friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves	pp=2.9311322409346334
elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr	pp=2.8391456240059796
darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat	pp=3.4993279439356124
it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present	pp=3.9611019749328498
a few weeks he believed	pp=2.099981179724088
when you have killed all your own birds mr	pp=2.905449255825619
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you	pp=4.214941536904335
elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion	pp=3.726759186223333
at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion	pp=3.9891346620756547
their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again  yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover	pp=3.9753643375688643
when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention	pp=3.7069127573576885
he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty	pp=4.435894182118573
but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent	pp=3.8627394473371277
when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs	pp=2.749993527590839
bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time	pp=4.3284801830607185
you are quite a visit in my debt mr	pp=2.8308653263068013
bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned	pp=3.874978627354427
i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement	pp=4.417824638718428
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business	pp=3.591091155173384
bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand ayear chapter xii	pp=4.5279319663755775
as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more mr	pp=3.5237223318590183
darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her	pp=1.9110984942093714
why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all	pp=3.3215935356904844
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	pp=2.657421055786625
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me	pp=3.9201600202450266
if he no longer cares for me why silent	pp=2.4951160808118624
teazing teazing man i will think no more about him	pp=2.8984703777012855
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth	pp=3.854927775057631
now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy	pp=3.38430167771401
i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming	pp=3.3992887302022283
i am glad he dines here on tuesday	pp=2.9450874149446484
yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly	pp=2.1938694552543248
oh jane take care	pp=1.4135620378958311
i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever	pp=4.176839448736902
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs	pp=2.8208004734653223
bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had revived	pp=3.7529405899069204
her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself	pp=3.3469857163032306
on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided	pp=3.647934143165122
he placed himself by her	pp=1.7000308483226763
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend	pp=3.0522400568709274
he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr	pp=4.1128311836388445
darcy with an expression of halflaughing alarm	pp=2.5985032030166475
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured	pp=4.1075132527845355
though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour	pp=3.3855998919395254
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour mr	pp=3.9315293810630245
darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them	pp=2.7593254450724234
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage	pp=3.311315356977815
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did	pp=4.132484750363243
her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family	pp=4.175814991473857
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance	pp=4.1144203677906415
anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawingroom before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil	pp=3.6639359911433194
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend	pp=3.5715335955606307
if he does not come to me _then_ said she i shall give him up for ever	pp=4.3974000341706025
the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair	pp=4.23203599203194
darcy had walked away to another part of the room	pp=3.0625992235633253
she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly  a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love	pp=3.952260201960095
is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman	pp=3.3593199852966604
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings  she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying  is your sister at pemberley still	pp=4.128009946115154
yes she will remain there till christmas	pp=2.2002948323932445
and quite alone	pp=1.5864181240995179
have all her friends left her mrs	pp=2.397259585662523
the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks	pp=2.686371695933485
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success	pp=3.988421536965127
he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whispering to elizabeth again he walked away	pp=3.5414831978769366
when the teathings were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party	pp=4.197248425570892
she now lost every expectation of pleasure	pp=2.1533898402186873
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself mrs	pp=4.783706281994796
bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them	pp=4.033683004559739
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day	pp=3.414867142056964
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you	pp=2.7986796915672008
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw	pp=2.8483951589475223
the venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch	pp=3.002530489077439
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucass last week and even mr	pp=3.0895260734199383
darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least	pp=3.6509467062600076
and what do you think she said besides ah mrs	pp=2.494116106608913
bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last	pp=2.7407990929105006
she did indeed	pp=2.876315881655276
long is as good a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously mrs	pp=3.6745303439345727
bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals	pp=4.4753884460660265
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth	pp=3.7865707075218586
the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other	pp=2.761820100958627
i hope we may often meet again elizabeth smiled	pp=2.830191894589178
you must not suspect me	pp=2.286300504806938
it mortifies me	pp=1.5785336170117354
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it	pp=3.5938352862004925
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection	pp=3.5228377570301594
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man	pp=3.8829817931632538
you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment	pp=3.829087683009966
how hard it is in some cases to be believed  and how impossible in others  but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge	pp=3.772805683088538
that is a question which i hardly know how to answer	pp=3.083056750283086
we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing	pp=3.2604869233874783
forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make _me_ your confidante chapter xiii	pp=4.093959664866907
a few days after this visit mr	pp=2.9620015837961184
bingley called again and alone	pp=1.6840375413673223
his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time	pp=3.271807372030663
he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits mrs	pp=3.765671197632607
bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	pp=3.656727899892591
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky	pp=3.4581200319204983
he should be particularly happy at any time c c	pp=3.355795622732036
and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them	pp=3.67478586847072
can you come tomorrow	pp=1.4138882967975168
yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity	pp=3.434124864062619
in ran mrs	pp=1.5800335190900598
bennet to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out  my dear jane make haste and hurry down	pp=3.7640754482192387
he is comemr	pp=6.3405059446926595
make haste make haste	pp=1.4140987767611752
here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown	pp=3.255236101452909
never mind miss lizzys hair	pp=1.7409439569063445
we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago	pp=4.587235638941699
oh hang kitty what has she to do with it	pp=2.70056081904959
come be quick be quick where is your sash my dear	pp=2.883522135881419
but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters	pp=3.72872237779387
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening	pp=3.3172431651807113
after tea mr	pp=1.9640201204035606
bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument	pp=3.263589857286396
two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs	pp=2.6678333581691294
elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma	pp=3.47776355700962
what do you keep winking at me for	pp=2.929146039119283
what am i to do	pp=1.3002631599577172
nothing child nothing	pp=1.5838883396193726
i did not wink at you	pp=3.187504333961125
she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty  come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room	pp=3.800730453465847
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it	pp=3.57409713997418
in a few minutes mrs	pp=2.735832825194266
bennet half opened the door and called out  lizzy my dear i want to speak with you	pp=4.078580692944318
elizabeth was forced to go	pp=2.119583125341771
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall	pp=4.131292272996425
kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressingroom	pp=2.8393949814948067
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawingroom mrs	pp=4.217657016126254
bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual	pp=2.193694983460443
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter	pp=3.8112832478656617
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs	pp=3.8906349077829483
bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband	pp=3.0831953736201467
after this day jane said no more of her indifference	pp=3.461131623344073
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr	pp=3.8173509511613988
seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence	pp=3.0804182435620584
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr	pp=2.4472922557526675
bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on	pp=2.78569201528796
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected	pp=2.9910024253103735
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him	pp=3.8541773070251697
bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter	pp=3.1129716333431463
elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes	pp=4.445477373933002
but on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her	pp=3.7822900244136237
_their_ situation was awkward enough but _hers_ she thought was still worse	pp=2.786521447984939
not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room	pp=3.986238904945436
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world	pp=3.712494749663135
tis too much she added by far too much	pp=2.684739303844473
i do not deserve it	pp=3.7002284899172113
oh why is not every body as happy	pp=2.5572287057004273
elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express	pp=3.057828505297989
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane	pp=2.9963447262538216
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present	pp=3.8374146111810985
i must go instantly to my mother she cried	pp=2.4424506490151647
i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself	pp=3.849957074932486
he is gone to my father already	pp=2.621981530281404
oh lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness  she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty	pp=4.167551351421087
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation	pp=3.6170167073855573
and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest most reasonable end  in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose	pp=4.292974203586246
where is your sister	pp=1.6770116440954446
said he hastily as he opened the door	pp=2.2734738158573493
with my mother up stairs	pp=1.7382770580188422
he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister	pp=3.7146715060355313
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship	pp=2.7694234948125143
they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself	pp=4.059228520778514
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever	pp=3.9591969229654937
kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon mrs	pp=2.914962365665572
bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr	pp=3.701055389479402
bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was	pp=3.4326468903738263
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said  jane i congratulate you	pp=4.289146842769361
you will be a very happy woman	pp=3.495126050982128
jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness	pp=2.9777880532392054
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together	pp=3.2565967367286905
i hope not so	pp=1.4050991384091176
exceed their income my dear mr	pp=1.9779847912894037
bennet cried his wife what are you talking of	pp=2.4254012034314445
then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night	pp=4.232287261228543
i knew how it would be	pp=1.8945143297559335
i always said it must be so at last	pp=2.9553859021962987
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together	pp=4.318663188098263
oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen  wickham lydia were all forgotten	pp=3.1901279002233185
jane was beyond competition her favourite child	pp=2.1752991579072525
at that moment she cared for no other	pp=2.83807312727211
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense	pp=4.163286908611684
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter	pp=3.758113804292224
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept	pp=4.4715751284609375
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur	pp=4.084887160297589
in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief	pp=4.2800202303756265
he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed it possible	pp=4.330660749391675
i suspected as much replied elizabeth	pp=1.987255931039396
but how did he account for it	pp=2.1599938577432813
it must have been his sisters doing	pp=2.656502045059324
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects	pp=3.9316157203997273
but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other	pp=4.080965427825295
that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter	pp=3.7245374730031053
good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard	pp=3.637632608566411
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities	pp=3.628455671943199
elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him	pp=4.3896723870702425
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried jane	pp=2.76501939718345
till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness	pp=3.1835720559087854
no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr	pp=3.5909123698509555
collins in time	pp=2.2802404744473526
bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs	pp=2.258131370342903
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune chapter xiv	pp=4.822510919404774
one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the diningroom their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn	pp=3.979572002008597
it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours	pp=3.9904296837856963
the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them	pp=3.2092264195021314
as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery	pp=4.22215569020561
they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered	pp=3.4096147963203696
it was lady catherine de bourgh	pp=1.868229861097743
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs	pp=3.920944634774442
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word	pp=3.46414927580979
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made mrs	pp=3.538953697576981
bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness	pp=3.3075807554064616
after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth  i hope you are well miss bennet	pp=3.9189750932168006
that lady i suppose is your mother	pp=2.4121766372910627
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was	pp=2.1535096486584555
and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters	pp=3.0195926469352705
yes madam said mrs	pp=1.409004014982653
bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine	pp=2.7731989800861583
she is my youngest girl but one	pp=2.1897443500111207
my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family	pp=3.8199166583776845
you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence	pp=3.349949690412863
it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass	pp=3.716905236726616
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west mrs	pp=4.242450107315062
bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added  may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well	pp=3.8590451962159147
yes very well	pp=2.276793626803604
i saw them the night before last	pp=2.1563546153916087
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling	pp=3.6680286762350356
but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled mrs	pp=3.470136650935035
bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth  miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn	pp=4.15684176888197
i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company	pp=4.564949589837776
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage	pp=2.9279903922278403
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs	pp=3.1282154800503954
as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on	pp=3.744796729142725
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable	pp=3.93538147559881
how could i ever think her like her nephew	pp=2.5152161018820647
said she as she looked in her face	pp=2.723774189907419
your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come	pp=2.789159468508028
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	pp=1.7402523826176397
indeed you are mistaken madam	pp=1.9102629721755138
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here	pp=4.173124863395489
miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with	pp=4.6023115055206665
but however insincere _you_ may choose to be you shall not find _me_ so	pp=3.470086975444103
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it	pp=3.715021475406793
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago	pp=3.253034877962516
i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that _you_ that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy	pp=3.7664782613824426
though i _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you	pp=4.304002816729378
if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far	pp=3.9434354036603425
what could your ladyship propose by it	pp=2.1747495844217597
at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted	pp=3.5346952625777215
your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence	pp=3.726657727148293
if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it	pp=3.034028934722124
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves	pp=2.5749324155826434
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad	pp=3.7397838300279123
i never heard that it was	pp=2.390330717713521
and can you likewise declare that there is no _foundation_ for it	pp=3.812389173857736
_you_ may ask questions which _i_ shall not choose to answer	pp=2.8596990507318063
this is not to be borne	pp=2.6767998113849467
miss bennet i insist on being satisfied	pp=2.4200744003264907
has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage	pp=2.0765370833190326
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	pp=2.621228991901108
but _your_ arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family	pp=3.9168877389853987
you may have drawn him in	pp=2.350726115805109
if i have i shall be the last person to confess it	pp=3.4862675402243464
miss bennet do you know who i am	pp=2.5479527571550467
i have not been accustomed to such language as this	pp=3.038863699337465
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns	pp=3.692003014170386
but you are not entitled to know _mine_ nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit	pp=3.8321696666578804
let me be rightly understood	pp=1.7406333854312683
this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr	pp=3.36817538917023
darcy is engaged to _my daughter_	pp=2.195618516455335
now what have you to say	pp=2.238388943384831
only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me	pp=4.255501410703526
from their infancy they have been intended for each other	pp=2.605397879720363
it was the favourite wish of _his_ mother as well as of hers	pp=3.8076525306604982
while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends	pp=4.267121747001738
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh	pp=2.0544940547088553
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy	pp=3.096752249353691
have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin	pp=3.059821280848709
yes and i had heard it before	pp=2.9552112389622605
but what is that to me	pp=2.3564263926348556
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh	pp=4.086789010098486
you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage	pp=3.0870644574347867
its completion depended on others if mr	pp=2.17667090540026
darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice	pp=3.326784829469902
and if i am that choice why may not i accept him	pp=3.550079533577402
yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all	pp=3.3685713865442013
you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him	pp=2.971089577700527
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us	pp=3.398280154070653
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine	pp=3.8633225830665783
obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring	pp=3.2189620194281687
is nothing due to me on that score	pp=2.2912358787997262
you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it	pp=3.536604755318281
i have not been used to submit to any persons whims	pp=3.659230321540085
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment	pp=3.128535619637768
_that_ will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on _me_	pp=3.245950978486849
hear me in silence	pp=1.4136154441225175
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other	pp=2.6088192889268993
they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families	pp=3.486759222695627
their fortune on both sides is splendid	pp=2.4115164621287053
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them	pp=3.4461274849533012
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune	pp=3.5593072904558642
if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up	pp=4.18187493024042
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere	pp=3.54131135995654
he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are equal true	pp=3.888249102898851
but who was your mother	pp=1.7328518823958745
who are your uncles and aunts	pp=1.9396436734574882
whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to _you_	pp=3.4846241703838783
though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moments deliberation  i am not	pp=4.351756428264638
lady catherine seemed pleased	pp=1.9955001812409483
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman	pp=2.786046739133819
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede	pp=3.1068155040249223
darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make _their_ marriage at all more probable	pp=3.2954818605137066
supposing him to be attached to me would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin	pp=3.680488291923533
allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged	pp=3.947725439336528
you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these	pp=3.2723948084634267
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine	pp=3.5469643009603655
i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject	pp=2.8922865988443758
not so hasty if you please	pp=1.978654356029326
i have by no means done	pp=3.3201004682216535
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement	pp=3.331733111023085
i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patchedup business at the expence of your father and uncles	pp=3.852300428626137
and is _such_ a girl to be my nephews sister	pp=2.950645672174534
heaven and earthof what are you thinking	pp=2.7478829249762504
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted	pp=2.4183492757715905
you can _now_ have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered	pp=2.3814440847002274
you have insulted me in every possible method	pp=2.9269328931154295
i must beg to return to the house	pp=2.675393724390121
and she rose as she spoke	pp=1.961437561661615
lady catherine rose also and they turned back	pp=2.3189313847570356
her ladyship was highly incensed	pp=1.9986424348475214
lady catherine i have nothing farther to say	pp=2.5546625200522963
you know my sentiments	pp=1.6811377943099
you are then resolved to have him	pp=2.1441572564453546
i have said no such thing	pp=1.9872935338376545
i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to _you_ or to any person so wholly unconnected with me	pp=3.529265409230191
it is well	pp=4.818918670778501
you refuse then to oblige me	pp=1.9342367968208345
you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude	pp=2.6182644264451365
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world	pp=4.109481609791048
neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance	pp=3.232554087309544
and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn	pp=4.407338109971215
and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well	pp=3.4747050994788116
i came to try you	pp=1.977829463074317
i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point	pp=3.263935093138457
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added  i take no leave of you miss bennet	pp=3.965155368185576
i send no compliments to your mother	pp=2.369596857631137
you deserve no such attention	pp=1.7332703062855845
i am most seriously displeased	pp=1.7406268025683063
elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself	pp=3.7739287934739987
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs	pp=2.708427156039596
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself	pp=3.207382197266064
she did not choose it said her daughter she would go	pp=3.4851763131873583
she is a very finelooking woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well	pp=3.7042753255837373
she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you	pp=3.871293272640232
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy	pp=2.899724354951016
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible chapter xv	pp=3.5270778027401204
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly	pp=4.386755559575813
it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley and _her_ being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea	pp=4.071428437080264
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together	pp=4.169536806246955
in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference	pp=4.206930476186137
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce	pp=4.30159102788426
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side	pp=4.239550467160849
with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning	pp=3.711017364205422
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him	pp=4.252869819844486
in that case he would return no more	pp=2.679458209256301
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it	pp=4.225686582575878
i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy	pp=3.1093439752862664
if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all	pp=4.258716459878722
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	pp=4.255300947159226
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room	pp=3.5137848702888648
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held	pp=4.34611552466402
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations	pp=3.942012829668956
he then said  i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly	pp=3.397437410740051
as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents	pp=2.8085654596813727
i did not know before that i had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony	pp=3.5581610308883014
let me congratulate you on a very important conquest	pp=2.469183126729272
the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued  you look conscious	pp=4.22939425595825
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the name of your admirer	pp=3.532742649079264
collins and what can _he_ have to say	pp=2.31932349144343
something very much to the purpose of course	pp=3.2195571813591943
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the goodnatured gossiping lucases	pp=3.7254107150780693
i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point	pp=3.4948155121019897
having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs	pp=2.4153844076614814
collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority	pp=3.982184879786444
your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land	pp=3.806340000583511
this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desiresplendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage	pp=3.283638830875203
yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of	pp=3.9538589346754245
have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is	pp=2.69848012838163
but now it comes out	pp=1.996284087065247
my motive for cautioning you is as follows	pp=2.336362423626521
could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related mr	pp=3.5863621220337216
darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life it is admirable  elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile	pp=4.062263946913695
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her	pp=3.0137883937744037
are you not diverted oh yes	pp=1.9984685295063223
pray read on	pp=1.570933500697722
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match	pp=3.9082057890439144
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned mr	pp=3.8083881458447193
collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known	pp=3.9521790190713406
i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married	pp=3.8845601479857788
it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it	pp=3.534989843320243
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing	pp=3.295319274101082
_that_ is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation and his expectation of a young olivebranch	pp=3.9662122044372845
but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it	pp=2.2209390935434334
for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn	pp=3.2260949363721374
oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted	pp=2.247800429944165
but it is so strange  yes_that_ is what makes it amusing	pp=3.3536386240928344
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr	pp=4.376806825488196
collinss correspondence for any consideration	pp=1.7341369023006932
nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my soninlaw	pp=3.764265665792659
and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report	pp=2.8052783620462685
did she call to refuse her consent	pp=2.1231650773945705
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it	pp=4.093469863390285
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not	pp=4.069112472326599
it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried	pp=2.6474536695620867
her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr	pp=3.1493348217551316
darcys indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too _little_ she might have fancied too _much_ chapter xvi	pp=3.9545907054062823
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr	pp=3.0095445169612707
bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit	pp=3.448881428828433
the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs	pp=2.1466204988005577
bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out	pp=3.7394612914126406
it was agreed to mrs	pp=2.1620950998063746
bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together	pp=3.6967723107280372
very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same	pp=3.8851648329916437
they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone	pp=3.783112699097331
darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours	pp=4.105129554612197
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister	pp=3.0644547310860286
ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it	pp=3.9879296117807432
were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express	pp=4.000954190170111
i did not think mrs	pp=2.8987956131816013
gardiner was so little to be trusted	pp=2.36384366126769
you must not blame my aunt	pp=2.504334169086054
lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars	pp=4.178304529407497
if you _will_ thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone	pp=2.8557324496812306
but your _family_ owe me nothing	pp=1.989691675369261
much as i respect them i believe i thought only of _you_	pp=3.5847875524961315
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word	pp=3.155770041567111
after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me	pp=3.6214810506795474
_my_ affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever	pp=3.4036330217190396
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances	pp=4.051882912950861
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable	pp=4.373656455218053
they walked on without knowing in what direction	pp=2.557936987577965
there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects	pp=3.941610379048831
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who _did_ call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which _she_ had refused to give	pp=4.025042302581309
but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise	pp=2.7054558167156735
it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before	pp=3.392009293958635
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly	pp=3.877207416643293
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_	pp=3.2472530123436987
what did you say of me that i did not deserve	pp=4.175851889606379
it was unpardonable	pp=9.280649334725956
i cannot think of it without abhorrence	pp=3.194458813052036
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth	pp=3.0933106766055047
the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility	pp=3.4382982763305887
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself	pp=2.7507692590746218
the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me	pp=3.9570354919558035
your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner	pp=2.424235958893369
those were your words	pp=1.4136048942425952
you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured methough it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice	pp=3.5030647667254877
i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression	pp=3.3821815743507178
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way	pp=4.217750285496664
i can easily believe it	pp=1.6240555329533128
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me	pp=3.558133841253629
oh do not repeat what i then said	pp=2.0971160957014985
these recollections will not do at all	pp=2.627323364885599
i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it	pp=3.099628807184384
darcy mentioned his letter	pp=1.412433111052693
did it said he did it _soon_ make you think better of me	pp=3.152911180372521
did you on reading it give any credit to its contents	pp=2.672042909271405
she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed	pp=3.3638439602206973
i hope you have destroyed the letter	pp=2.9597752226314458
there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again	pp=3.77763631467185
the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies	pp=3.784545525680462
when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit	pp=4.175428617440033
the adieu is charity itself	pp=1.7407184777369837
but think no more of the letter	pp=2.20939820911475
the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten	pp=4.218580857209607
you must learn some of my philosophy	pp=2.1501144919195245
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure	pp=3.270191804529275
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind	pp=2.6326361254643196
_your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance	pp=3.614367279199577
but with _me_ it is not so	pp=2.515694137740663
painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled	pp=3.4589391354309824
i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle	pp=3.873760225675525
as a child i was taught what was _right_ but i was not taught to correct my temper	pp=3.4349414700866325
such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous	pp=3.5506190977465586
by you i was properly humbled	pp=2.2249679276089447
i came to you without a doubt of my reception	pp=3.1266973416048853
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	pp=3.303752608339944
indeed i had	pp=3.072168902706134
what will you think of my vanity	pp=2.4135100012987696
i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses	pp=2.7778626236942263
my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you	pp=3.5933067916969406
i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong	pp=2.9035065221639456
how you must have hated me after _that_ evening	pp=3.232577422901812
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley	pp=3.267661712759745
your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you	pp=3.810456707699278
my object _then_ replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to	pp=4.1457971749315705
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you	pp=4.031550762135444
he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend	pp=4.126011827071074
she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther	pp=3.9136615879150494
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home	pp=3.9810970295259627
what could become of mr	pp=1.6770128294849544
bingley and jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs	pp=3.252463059465268
darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it	pp=3.4084332630798553
i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth	pp=2.4867273544433033
not at all	pp=1.1241763237345632
when i went away i felt that it would soon happen	pp=3.6112826137275156
that is to say you had given your permission	pp=2.4916639749662273
i guessed as much	pp=1.4095200116923607
and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case	pp=3.942327962017635
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago	pp=3.9888472709855356
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent	pp=3.237396047716085
his surprise was great	pp=1.4120652520239896
he had never had the slightest suspicion	pp=2.5959733422579783
i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together	pp=4.370440457083814
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring	pp=3.653897708000418
from the former	pp=6.756584960255579
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection	pp=3.464996451055287
bingley is most unaffectedly modest	pp=1.740933790838024
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy	pp=3.7339854043672975
i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him	pp=3.339532513338545
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him	pp=4.449830651971744
he was angry	pp=7.8135343877167776
but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments	pp=3.7060197641280657
he has heartily forgiven me now	pp=1.9892639490900978
elizabeth longed to observe that mr	pp=2.1961688092046767
bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself	pp=3.707465972377707
in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house	pp=4.046674676871235
my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to	pp=4.3035617892679
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table	pp=4.103981990375055
she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge	pp=3.7820998429608417
she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth	pp=3.5707631177388
the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary	pp=2.8239351751741237
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent	pp=2.690725513721919
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	pp=4.005390320692342
at night she opened her heart to jane	pp=2.6322413678713303
though suspicion was very far from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here	pp=3.0854126087070592
you are joking lizzy	pp=1.4124317685114938
this cannot beengaged to mr	pp=1.6630134221860093
darcy no no you shall not deceive me	pp=2.6909183719568737
i know it to be impossible	pp=1.850376962680815
this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not	pp=4.079534801570472
yet indeed i am in earnest	pp=3.038098444293525
i speak nothing but the truth	pp=2.178650510705217
he still loves me and we are engaged	pp=2.3184116256559677
jane looked at her doubtingly	pp=3.1505683368443886
oh lizzy it cannot be	pp=1.7313991257534302
i know how much you dislike him	pp=2.6372904210453734
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now	pp=4.067052379805417
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself	pp=3.172891346828813
miss bennet still looked all amazement	pp=1.9896937017439202
my dear dear lizzy i wouldi do congratulate youbut are you certain	pp=3.1888099371729157
forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be happy with him	pp=3.1397537261221773
it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world	pp=3.836613816333898
but are you pleased jane	pp=1.9906699158855214
shall you like to have such a brother	pp=2.72238028406754
very very much	pp=1.9887071919410215
but we considered it we talked of it as impossible	pp=2.6955298218120523
oh lizzy do any thing rather than marry without affection	pp=2.865854606439436
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do	pp=3.193674590876074
oh yes you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do when i tell you all	pp=3.7429415080117256
why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley	pp=2.8847787990468294
i am afraid you will be angry	pp=3.320037729984341
my dearest sister now _be_ be serious	pp=2.416926893576547
i want to talk very seriously	pp=2.604687179913009
it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began	pp=3.7817523975920575
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley	pp=3.502247524118787
another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment	pp=3.822255047205577
when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish	pp=3.32191213665639
now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself	pp=4.138476728484362
i always had a value for him	pp=2.3600929372978285
were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingleys friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me	pp=3.7025998943893743
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know of it to another not to you	pp=3.8364774291629433
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy	pp=2.2670655190473896
she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend	pp=4.5128470540574535
all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation	pp=2.5297312078615883
good gracious cried mrs	pp=1.6669825631318886
bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr	pp=3.7682824578739957
darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here	pp=3.733372932917847
i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company	pp=3.8809212320349884
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud mr	pp=4.543686082727436
bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today	pp=3.0278197499381134
i advise mr	pp=1.9681635948710465
darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs	pp=2.1431016619163072
bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning	pp=2.5321228376695917
it is a nice long walk and mr	pp=3.2743277446351655
darcy has never seen the view	pp=1.950962561609092
it may do very well for the others replied mr	pp=2.953775486226469
bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty	pp=5.2369115929747965
wont it kitty	pp=1.586296719477823
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home	pp=3.784691977832666
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented	pp=3.2460002760027282
as she went up stairs to get ready mrs	pp=2.3631185771942254
bennet followed her saying  i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself	pp=3.8156769722662833
but i hope you will not mind it it is all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then	pp=4.148547286530356
so do not put yourself to inconvenience	pp=2.152521978762454
during their walk it was resolved that mr	pp=2.312064945234949
bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening	pp=2.1472851640109702
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers	pp=2.6403674165873907
she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	pp=3.792488552071438
but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr	pp=3.975583341773704
darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation	pp=2.927537512678443
in the evening soon after mr	pp=2.6519241376394205
bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr	pp=2.606738569538068
darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme	pp=2.9897050764037076
she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that _she_ his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr	pp=4.3517711112684605
darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile	pp=3.308791575719191
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library	pp=4.144011859045539
she was gone directly	pp=1.68032593940497
her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious	pp=2.996207085020434
lizzy said he what are you doing	pp=3.0308916522606526
have not you always hated him	pp=1.9853836319655382
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr darcy	pp=3.9085542669768416
or in other words you are determined to have him	pp=2.5671013943227385
he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane	pp=4.022941130260314
but will they make you happy	pp=1.9804307866843784
have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference	pp=3.1697185241058423
none at all	pp=1.1686705729378295
we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him	pp=4.184084684071603
indeed he has no improper pride	pp=1.9928320344071366
you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms	pp=4.2091857023816175
lizzy said her father i have given him my consent	pp=3.7469297070802607
he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask	pp=4.114639244926287
i now give it to _you_ if you are resolved on having him	pp=3.3429918814010353
but let me advise you to think better of it	pp=3.1106393659127756
i know your disposition lizzy	pp=1.7389084257721557
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior	pp=3.751339201128505
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage	pp=3.2389662625194777
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery	pp=2.150752577246526
my child let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life	pp=3.3016080385866493
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr	pp=3.5585458077665697
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say	pp=3.5956679714231763
if this be the case he deserves you	pp=2.937968488876477
i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy	pp=3.805134263719757
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr	pp=2.6970836449345286
darcy had voluntarily done for lydia	pp=1.977437291356794
he heard her with astonishment	pp=1.9579869188033425
it will save me a world of trouble and economy	pp=2.5320331311501745
had it been your uncles doing i must and _would_ have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way	pp=3.4542756222672812
i shall offer to pay him tomorrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter	pp=3.723160569572312
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr	pp=2.959651202855158
every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time	pp=4.411536029029984
when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her and made the important communication	pp=3.7878703867626826
its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs	pp=2.69103745248758
bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable	pp=2.834812437605676
nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them	pp=4.083790712718831
she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself	pp=3.173900651637598
good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr	pp=2.611237020347518
darcy who would have thought it and is it really true	pp=2.78042619260561
oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pinmoney what jewels what carriages you will have janes is nothing to itnothing at all	pp=3.883335457098784
i am so pleasedso happy	pp=2.39970447145102
such a charming manso handsome so talloh my dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before	pp=3.7578082265626915
dear dear lizzy	pp=1.685019810659645
a house in town every thing that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me	pp=3.4121841083121836
i shall go distracted	pp=1.681620491142944
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away	pp=3.832627383938516
but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her	pp=4.012194096776235
you must and shall be married by a special licence	pp=2.5983439167371998
but my dearest love tell me what dish mr	pp=3.0429528268614647
this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for	pp=3.8645570587753646
bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion	pp=3.6087159553706023
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr	pp=3.902943511491188
bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem	pp=4.280157860057195
i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly said he	pp=2.4915371393081682
wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well as janes chapter xviii	pp=4.052656697066677
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her	pp=3.2365583313910626
how could you begin said she	pp=2.214942926628426
i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place	pp=3.240697805453002
i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation	pp=3.0554492822103403
it is too long ago	pp=1.7387471916387138
i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun	pp=3.5894610813786985
my beauty you had early withstood and as for my mannersmy behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not	pp=4.013396325952958
now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence	pp=2.5956687792774957
for the liveliness of your mind i did	pp=2.2981785833092925
you may as well call it impertinence at once	pp=3.010865882448328
it was very little less	pp=3.0005753555313737
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention	pp=3.465952417620782
i roused and interested you because i was so unlike _them_	pp=2.9746163901673395
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you	pp=3.843194975169165
therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable	pp=4.092412811746874
to be sure you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love	pp=3.4896183202355178
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield	pp=3.1263030040815867
dearest jane who could have done less for her	pp=2.78588813088747
but make a virtue of it by all means	pp=2.442016884993148
my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last	pp=4.108341321869547
what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here	pp=3.1734507487334045
why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me	pp=2.7303602491978745
because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement	pp=2.647194025075313
but i was embarrassed	pp=2.113858534229277
you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner	pp=3.1711020596335806
a man who had felt less might	pp=3.226348779464048
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you _would_ have gone on if you had been left to yourself	pp=4.671218754310928
i wonder when you _would_ have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect	pp=3.722366862073507
_too much_ i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject	pp=3.698946132158502
this will never do	pp=1.4105946923143613
you need not distress yourself	pp=2.1662994724487334
the moral will be perfectly fair	pp=1.9887467985155995
lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts	pp=3.333920383572654
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours	pp=3.726570806763986
my aunts intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing	pp=3.583760887371503
but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for	pp=3.1325686743017376
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed	pp=2.847376454742717
or had you intended any more serious consequence	pp=2.3661936542848014
my real purpose was to see _you_ and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me	pp=3.3980177339526545
my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made	pp=3.761187684503981
i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth	pp=2.7689326880022005
but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly	pp=4.301435145861755
and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did	pp=3.803468074134796
but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected	pp=3.6347539216314875
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr	pp=2.6471809320284536
you supposed more than really existed	pp=1.9930143467444048
but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err	pp=3.636113544634695
i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes	pp=4.035129648665389
how could i be so silly as to wish it your idea of the ponies is delightful	pp=3.686484485156348
i am the happiest creature in the world	pp=2.025304700496836
perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice	pp=2.8523406149996022
i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh mr	pp=2.7771673146881164
darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me	pp=3.3798596658290623
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas yours c mr	pp=3.4076313868032835
darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr	pp=4.096378064810863
bennet sent to mr	pp=1.4010052086587463
collins in reply to his last	pp=2.2892278676564217
dear sir  i must trouble you once more for congratulations	pp=2.601970272264966
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy	pp=2.581840693202931
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew	pp=2.93476460782356
he has more to give	pp=1.6809905028595447
miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere	pp=3.536462858600129
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in sending it	pp=3.129935195091323
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	pp=3.5370378022503206
before any answer could arrive from mr	pp=2.1795457939289444
collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge	pp=3.449387510373653
at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr	pp=4.092465080767993
darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband	pp=3.239880903695868
if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight mrs	pp=4.614132838922593
philipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs	pp=2.9223021839290513
philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good humour encouraged yet whenever she _did_ speak she must be vulgar	pp=4.048225777194522
nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant	pp=3.5301124047960992
elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley chapter xix	pp=4.406694589848963
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs	pp=2.7397563190036416
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs	pp=2.352430000729029
bingley and talked of mrs	pp=1.9362089347741491
darcy may be guessed	pp=1.4141327079816122
bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do	pp=3.499544541524868
he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected mr	pp=3.148334816676471
bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth	pp=2.8927002313363444
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper or _her_ affectionate heart	pp=3.6114451702383072
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other	pp=4.06908667517974
kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters	pp=3.689151150874271
in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great	pp=3.3878598401384403
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid	pp=3.7574255606470204
from the farther disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs	pp=3.405306613581092
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs	pp=4.314412916693483
bennets being quite unable to sit alone	pp=2.1608585948742207
mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance	pp=4.251250747580441
as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters	pp=3.309666413924189
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune	pp=4.2918773257797085
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished	pp=3.486519960413927
darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy	pp=3.8677120848378923
it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us	pp=4.271963257058906
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help	pp=4.192621733165647
any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr	pp=3.3565049320057305
darcy about it if you had rather not yours c	pp=2.9827981326685293
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them	pp=3.7701436522790743
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills	pp=4.1346785929071865
their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme	pp=3.3950814792348734
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought	pp=3.2416387212750797
though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley yet for elizabeths sake he assisted him farther in his profession	pp=3.1525297457123385
lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone	pp=3.7727174939661934
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth	pp=4.008610829557795
pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see	pp=3.4187884363021785
they were able to love each other even as well as they intended	pp=3.699392569759693
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother	pp=3.4683254625804127
he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry	pp=3.534985093022883
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way	pp=2.930542211925289
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end	pp=4.31542594189345
but at length by elizabeths persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	pp=4.471935773263152
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms	pp=2.891150720705994
darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them	pp=4.344818678890416
