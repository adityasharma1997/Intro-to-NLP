chapter i	1
it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	2.8995922878468847
my dear mr	1
bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last mr	1.9674952163757422
but it is returned she for mrs	2.40301255338824
long has just been here and she told me all about it	3.1337390955002284
bennet made no answer	1
do not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently	3.297310067626366
you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it	3.085783897855747
this was invitation enough	1
why my dear you must know mrs	2.9259866022422667
long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr	3.6740188645715013
morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week	4.417843390112993
is he married or single oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year	1.5901357266808227
what a fine thing for our girls how so how can it affect them my dear mr	2.6697383849217515
bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them	3.417194753444329
is that his design in settling here design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes	3.756469069861079
i see no occasion for that	2.027991878166527
you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr	2.946325648098938
bingley might like you the best of the party	1.6971722039139472
my dear you flatter me	1
when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty	2.2072611443555963
in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of	4.1312785470909485
but my dear you must indeed go and see mr	1.8507488786267696
bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood	1.2402601289120232
it is more than i engage for i assure you	2.4717980342120356
but consider your daughters	1
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them	1.8557474782082508
indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not	2.948853143251286
i dare say mr	1
bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy	3.363263200231978
i desire you will do no such thing	2.763236780432388
lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia	3.2568400240150748
but you are always giving her the preference	1.4890243456271373
they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters	1.9991444445275615
bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take delight in vexing me	2.7085728382298777
you have no compassion on my poor nerves	3.499414814123797
they are my old friends	1
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least	1.6509832099431276
ah you do not know what i suffer	3.7856909438866313
but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood	2.1266801319195
it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them	2.700022562758158
depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all	6.350349381035589
her mind was less difficult to develope	1.2285732515306538
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous	1.3607797238983066
the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news	2.2261686305112205
chapter ii	1
bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr	2.139898616000634
bingley	1
he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it	3.7031205294336957
it was then disclosed in the following manner	1.1438066295985414
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr	1.4610774203073915
bingley will like it lizzy	1
we are not in a way to know what mr	2.5088187548960335
bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit	2.5160982211699747
long has promised to introduce him	1.8138482996746945
i do not believe mrs	1
long will do any such thing	1.3465933175511762
she has two nieces of her own	1.3419086129604005
she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her	2.7568233860545304
bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you	2.7375400374326553
bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters	1.8872272456635022
don t keep coughing so kitty for heaven s sake have a little compassion on my nerves	2.022828960720172
you tear them to pieces	1
kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill	1.5210152132749872
i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully	2.2974395171817785
when is your next ball to be lizzy to morrow fortnight	2.446011741236932
aye so it is cried her mother and mrs	2.6649390422995265
long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself	4.952503389011053
then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr	4.733877048381559
bingley to her	1
impossible mr	1
bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing i honour your circumspection	4.495147140031714
but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs	3.2567159424117578
long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself	2.481845288179273
the girls stared at their father	1.4715947786974297
bennet said only nonsense nonsense what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he	1.6551010295520834
do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there	1.862206451193465
what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts	2.6098657847611513
mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how	1.1701734358921019
bingley	1
bingley cried his wife	1
i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him	2.748028793521447
it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now	3.2537498801817257
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs	5.388286032676484
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while	3.4092769025938847
how good it was in you my dear mr	2.894229677153641
bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last	2.002563422652186
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance	1.2352407202634512
well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now	3.618751126355245
now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr	1.9319715375084983
bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife	2.48047967244495
what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut	2.998431970515647
at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing	3.4534817422382815
lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr	4.903808286329697
bingley will dance with you at the next ball	1.3094008695738428
oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the youngest i m the tallest	2.937965138701719
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr	4.153227509516617
bennet s visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner	1.820550836896036
chapter iii	1
not all that mrs	1
bingley	1
they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas	1.9380096355840863
her report was highly favourable	1
sir william had been delighted with him	1.627012742232077
he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party	2.360543768787131
nothing could be more delightful to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr	2.0941184379460687
bingley s heart were entertained	1
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs	2.82115461950964
bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for	3.201056043829596
bingley returned mr	1
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father	3.6507487464214043
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs	2.1889372121579744
bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all	2.025458997094755
bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation c	2.6656590230109884
bennet was quite disconcerted	1
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be	2.857379523614019
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr	3.423483420967594
bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	1.7890589376212314
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin	3.06334014732388
and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr	2.048036051550591
bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man	3.5313401064090346
bingley was good looking and gentleman like he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners	1.9669036757644256
his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion	1.9058425766174885
his brother in law mr	1
hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr	3.1143808956007764
bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend	2.2246804736860373
bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield	2.428710134183283
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves	1.6632097047855383
what a contrast between him and his friend mr	2.354243555644707
darcy danced only once with mrs	2.140735223484322
his character was decided	1
he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again	2.92972714106574
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr	2.4821045460668536
darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr	1.9998543207444712
bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it	4.795540357338355
come darcy said he i must have you dance	2.1327326083391247
you had much better dance	1
i certainly shall not	1
at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable	2.564495216484568
i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty	2.6038570373951746
you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr	3.4308140911195406
darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet	1.4462345377721295
oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable	2.27216153086671
do let me ask my partner to introduce you	1.4711986135940793
which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men	2.537527635247315
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me	1.7342731381266643
bingley followed his advice	1
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous	2.072212998713908
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party	1.592898468424227
bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters	2.3609947311108983
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way	3.2156870575196663
elizabeth felt jane s pleasure	1
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants	2.3643076499316136
with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations	4.543012970856906
he had rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear	3.154606411509322
oh my dear mr	1
bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball	3.2158101979349873
i wish you had been there	1.7850143419032865
jane was so admired nothing could be like it	1.2949242212523977
every body said how well she looked and mr	1.8274728111053191
bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice	1.4653089280270821
only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time	4.157884132131848
first of all he asked miss lucas	1.4821447678331494
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance	3.251170991548078
so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next	2.453088889096767
then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for god s sake say no more of his partners	2.201719851839018
oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance oh my dear continued mrs	3.016291096421251
bennet i am quite delighted with him	2.7479373111925525
he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women	2.763378385360119
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses	2.1436907317313163
i dare say the lace upon mrs	1.7286334286156353
hurst s gown here she was interrupted again	3.027547974982935
bennet protested against any description of finery	1.3693863389879846
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr	1.888867240517053
darcy	1
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing	2.2395401498538514
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs	2.0374829686220393
chapter iv	1
when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr	3.2144516952614586
he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can	2.3600958538898715
his character is thereby complete	1
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time	1.858567428311852
i did not expect such a compliment	5.972501415095074
did not you i did for you	4.482777064630462
compliments always take you by surprise and me never	4.281691289990659
what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room	2.8229832051870893
no thanks to his gallantry for that	1.4775269535280897
well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him	2.0387263430007247
you have liked many a stupider person	1.7499326967371966
dear lizzy oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general	2.945620626930663
you never see a fault in any body	1.3364207778776953
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes	3.4938515802922683
i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think	4.986656078896403
i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder	3.6451013122751617
with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough one meets it every where	2.7515437008035843
but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body s character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone	2.639502654864111
and so you like this man s sisters too do you their manners are not equal to his	2.1644462737630543
certainly not at first	1
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them	2.5268928864222775
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her	3.7578248849052795
elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them	3.30843553952934
they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited	1.8724914098973062
they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others	2.0883888214613076
bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it	1.8206435213560355
bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase	2.2490650006720694
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs	3.137521004778165
hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her	2.9842035310158925
he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately	2.6705360858963014
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character	5.993375969327268
bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied	2.690812055810528
on the strength of darcy s regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion	2.0516869849131054
bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever	2.457759652025776
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	3.0868556880057327
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence	1.6403383567897059
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic	1.866486414553891
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful	3.1151514563645555
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much	2.2107065468743583
hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of	3.699842304320023
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose	2.771238416819249
chapter v	1
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate	2.274893717417753
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty	3.429878974350551
for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body	2.399621740866133
by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st	1.2771605943828002
james s had made him courteous	1.4198803696627125
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs	2.2896451621823752
bennet	1
they had several children	1
the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeth s intimate friend	1.520345268711346
you began the evening well charlotte said mrs	1.802007057507915
bennet with civil self command to miss lucas	1.133772376970041
you were mr	1
bingley s first choice	1
yes but he seemed to like his second better	2.366975872344077
oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice	1.9535858609130157
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr	2.9865305723303806
robinson	1
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr	1.9817440116878926
robinson did not i mention it to you mr	5.572775714688348
robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point	2.9255439674531973
upon my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know	3.3734172134363747
my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte	1.502656798005876
darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable	2.7782799344068096
long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	4.631024814314033
are you quite sure ma am is not there a little mistake said jane	1.6654243975090266
i certainly saw mr	1
darcy speaking to her	1
aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to	2.9039602224150936
miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance	1.8643278285950993
with them he is remarkably agreeable	1.1198668997855905
i do not believe a word of it my dear	4.2339553789959705
long	1
but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs	2.6117875657346175
long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza	2.356088526906811
another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you	2.946422665374107
i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him	1.340548608126584
his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it	1.9183756845862707
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself	2.727439521659779
if i may so express it he has a right to be proud	4.618419340481473
that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine	3.1715084154464686
pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe	2.1030325562595507
by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary	2.5923713406124778
vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously	1.5501194749844707
a person may be proud without being vain	2.0754310245910386
if i were as rich as mr	2.1772693553394005
darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was	3.491739676672678
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs	1.7427253509143228
bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly	4.294148596198774
the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit	3.26409190870961
chapter vi	1
the visit was returned in due form	1.6369164199325128
miss bennet s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs	3.4355451262147456
hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest	2.303185481427267
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration	3.1067951975928354
it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent	3.925627402196929
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas	2.2340920894927137
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark	3.481213935997399
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself	2.0352389522990757
we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement	1.9931226482569688
in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels	1.5359228296780605
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on	3.474127544392863
but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow	2.5822452007398904
if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too	2.6914553879644103
remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do	3.160400758362954
but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out	3.0213342700427526
perhaps he must if he sees enough of her	2.481984892022954
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together	2.045368380689284
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention	1.7143825850578511
when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses	1.9163038194658957
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it	3.6734587391009277
but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by design	2.2175289381388437
as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness	2.624406148533438
she has known him only a fortnight	2.6555231070561627
she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times	2.3934336033976935
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character	3.0129692963880985
had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal	2.641306620491004
yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded	1.6352377661048791
well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth	3.77263595978143
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance	1.8591872056311574
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least	2.0154803172662556
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life	3.297993184993024
you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself	2.305656792263294
darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise	2.9656103616328813
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes	3.9676746647049725
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying	1.0177958293558782
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness	2.342005356570704
of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with	4.037941150407437
he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others	3.4345211034378784
his doing so drew her notice	1.0110304872470672
what does mr	1
darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster that is a question which mr	1.9046052975453815
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about	3.651030653649305
on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think mr	3.1519814610905916
darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic	3.0031905218463595
it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas	1.9926354164943323
i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows	1.7929202654261405
you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers	2.304100766460994
on miss lucas s persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must	3.225761021701286
and gravely glancing at mr	1
darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song	1.609928769884189
after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display	2.7434019890505414
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached	1.8166328234383338
elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room	2.45007116573862
what a charming amusement for young people this is mr	1.3608319328096519
darcy there is nothing like dancing after all	2.1676417345628414
i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies	2.300733441677361
certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world	2.0730646649978453
every savage can dance	1
sir william only smiled	1
your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr	2.330528498518226
darcy	1
you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir	1.3923414542817139
yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight	1.9583884950146424
do you often dance at st	1.652026775036545
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it	5.515557687954446
you have a house in town i conclude mr	2.304251065974412
darcy bowed	1
i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas	3.240328693581935
darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner	3.586842411858077
you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you	2.5326453780031657
and taking her hand he would have given it to mr	4.023604580560357
darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing	1.783790865764981
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner	2.2634594180160663
darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain	2.1279766674271676
you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour	3.1412093657875864
darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling	1.0178083953967394
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie	3.5602299662457018
i should imagine not	1
you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion	2.8984054832696713
i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you	1.858118299086639
my mind was more agreeably engaged	1.357123636936575
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	4.260811571768065
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections	2.8840642690727685
darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet	1.0992666885159934
miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley	2.0126799879199146
i am all astonishment	1
a lady s imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment	1.589709061677061
i knew you would be wishing me joy	1.405671996976756
nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled	4.721836339887266
you will have a charming mother in law indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you	3.5581024288862952
he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long	2.2849100275808776
chapter vii	1
bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mother s fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his	2.122283046351552
her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds	2.2215950559448596
she had a sister married to a mr	4.139982080302065
philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade	3.4273331364373187
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner s shop just over the way	2.0187650301751323
the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt	2.8175100863047042
at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters	2.7496529364029376
their visits to mrs	1
philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence	1.3903939509606804
their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves	3.02777873911187
they could talk of nothing but officers and mr	1.6060291520605188
bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country	1.7698802874173802
i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced	2.408420942614122
catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london	3.0995731289798707
i am astonished my dear said mrs	2.3119912768822353
bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly	3.487230305975558
if i wished to think slightingly of any body s children it should not be of my own however	2.6155066452253384
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it	1.422680351377281
yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever	3.3421158425027824
this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree	3.530380380533703
my dear mr	1
bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother	4.318695757347832
when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do	3.572972579931255
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in his regimentals	2.6829089971966233
mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library	1.687522405828715
bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer	3.3497359384213343
bennet s eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love	2.8585849803587653
it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud	2.9399397550460584
my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole day s tête à tête between two women can never end without a quarrel	2.9816757960681946
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this	1.9163322827738734
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers	3.6628372721474856
yours ever caroline bingley	1
with the officers cried lydia	1
i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that	2.612743520735291
dining out said mrs	1
bennet that is very unlucky	1
can i have the carriage said jane	2.598863506665764
no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night	2.436750658229798
oh but the gentlemen will have mr	3.3148143923951947
i had much rather go in the coach	1.5666547892040938
but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure	2.0888391994808537
they are wanted in the farm mr	1.6684994512070945
bennet are not they they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them	2.0927681059285455
but if you have got them to day said elizabeth my mother s purpose will be answered	3.8884230834853777
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged	1.6565155855966784
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day	2.689740677392767
her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted	2.35182646932837
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back	2.2543208436488786
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs	2.583844204052274
bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own	2.2050595005876668
till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance	3.651312445622437
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth my dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday	2.973761598445767
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better	2.136332797826644
they insist also on my seeing mr	3.144907850244428
jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me	2.8465351398605816
yours c	1
well my dear said mr	1
bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr	3.2866243199578333
bingley and under your orders	1
oh i am not at all afraid of her dying	3.3290789732616353
people do not die of little trifling colds	1.2437268597740667
she will be taken good care of	2.3770154449100827
as long as she stays there it is all very well	1.8736040865283188
i would go and see her if i could have the carriage	2.8505438158782868
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horse woman walking was her only alternative	3.326531350652385
she declared her resolution	1
i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want	2.43405985147251
is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses no indeed	3.3707398492401754
i do not wish to avoid the walk	3.512299866189246
the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles	1.431967546549926
i shall be back by dinner	3.05278828261849
i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required	2.2472841349036523
we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia	3.7841903649670687
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together	1.7614712582840497
if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes	2.1631425212831923
she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise	2.6846850216365614
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs	2.9062864651376725
hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it	3.3825740968226996
darcy said very little and mr	1.4312667336749498
hurst nothing at all	1
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone	2.023555012579537
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast	1.4138666188036801
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	3.126869619598793
miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room	2.2173132929074737
she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with	2.906439698479339
elizabeth silently attended her	1
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane	2.4494194279552572
the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts	3.3645936723862695
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere	2.102929255255472
when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so	3.2057370531474585
miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present	3.035768944980715
elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes	2.1982053905598655
chapter viii	1
at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner	1.704018789659486
to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr	2.0193450119714913
jane was by no means better	1.8418305091172984
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency	3.9196094949626796
she had very little notice from any but him	3.8004325560884538
miss bingley was engrossed by mr	2.6243893348081984
darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr	1.9693599786910516
hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her	1.897739659104009
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	3.209430064171596
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty	2.6088593726634084
hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker	2.387100917267733
i shall never forget her appearance this morning	1.2024311708360056
she really looked almost wild	1
she did indeed louisa	1
i could hardly keep my countenance	1.9274152049622406
your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me	1.4454619688029644
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning	2.7387618134103735
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice	1.0122236810058614
you observed it mr	1
certainly not	1
to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum	1.621650507209171
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley	3.8810381255794986
i am afraid mr	1
darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes	2.3128901217643194
hurst began again	1
but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it	2.967245988134125
i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton	3.152489143078184
yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside	1.6828115600252818
that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily	3.0730034167081692
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable	1.7494076110648606
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy	3.0366285956320884
to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations	1.906249147760329
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself	3.3419906112174003
on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book	2.8553648493514574
hurst looked at her with astonishment	1.854566061222005
do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular	1.3046785767578266
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else	2.022048756736175
in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well	3.110745572365626
elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying	2.623775363084583
he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded	1.345707421904135
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into	3.293649164899831
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books	2.7117496536313097
what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr	2.139851062509829
and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books	1.7919089510349702
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these	1.6143860509829666
neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place	2.136728395624626
charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley	1.8511703737636855
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire	1.5058636982251772
with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it	1.6230092062305512
i am talking of possibilities charles	1.019230561820735
upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation	2.6055472715576675
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between mr	1.7818326419800423
bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game	4.319368714038408
is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am i think she will	2.707608352446044
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height or rather taller	2.0570663796060145
how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much	2.636497538948055
such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the piano forte is exquisite	2.5145702077483536
all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean yes all of them i think	2.455022234671213
they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses	1.0223133356264513
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished	2.961901812712206
your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth	1.6896425744330275
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen	1.5484835271159616
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general	1.7336035380712724
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished	2.644183303435064
nor i i am sure said miss bingley	2.3445458678095337
then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman	3.4796713492321247
oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with	1.4881785682372002
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved	2.220638953429931
all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading	2.8094838040008865
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women	1.3932615415295704
i rather wonder now at your knowing any	1.767655517257968
are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this i never saw such a woman	2.7486373146957446
i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united	1.3835516600429922
hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr	1.8462572173746354
hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward	1.2535359851307537
as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room	1.5932895350437353
but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art	2.625162738938961
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable	1.020004663300979
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject	3.1181328859548954
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her	3.1983096854340225
this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal and it was settled that mr	3.0365701857021246
jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better	2.9068705980654106
bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable	1.4028695229203756
they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	2.2888722762954297
chapter ix	1
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr	4.492748790622013
bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters	1.723668913979039
in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation	2.4620637226781614
the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with	1.5408096473195598
bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast	2.6031863692546473
had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs	2.3268234622632384
bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield	1.966973024938961
she would not listen therefore to her daughter s proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable	2.2670314608856854
after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingley s appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour	3.3931496662625364
bingley met them with hopes that mrs	1.7934981759980604
bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected	2.2761640086582675
indeed i have sir was her answer	2.687005133725845
she is a great deal too ill to be moved	1.74978789642616
jones says we must not think of moving her	1.721702143452632
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness	1.6880445577362875
removed cried bingley	1
it must not be thought of	2.148741396830042
my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal	2.6729259681082054
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with	2.94516133410875
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her	1.9271235423749784
you have a sweet room here mr	3.298007083875279
bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk	1.2390912450621738
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease	2.5472443164486953
whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes	2.5304373656626797
at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here	3.1353305173211936
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth	3.006297758855912
you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her	1.5544403568324137
oh yes i understand you perfectly	1.361300408891419
i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful	4.496477347628146
that is as it happens	1
lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home	2.8672430921960066
i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character	2.1577729465500157
it must be an amusing study	1.7163474592806323
yes but intricate characters are the most amusing	1.0132365607495906
they have at least that advantage	1.529063929086508
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society	1.1538603165383057
but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever	1.9034652108620078
every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away	3.1521653033129557
bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph	1.6007411610356554
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places	2.9931029206636492
bingley when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same	3.195019790620763
they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either	2.11589336010902
aye that is because you have the right disposition	1.9215990843018746
but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all	2.1610460568408847
indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother	1.5482163617926061
you quite mistook mr	1
darcy	1
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true	3.483892873945723
certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger	2.454171922972762
i know we dine with four and twenty families	1.1084162059697218
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance	1.3696084431588706
his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr	1.718066218282231
darcy with a very expressive smile	1.9104431246314018
elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away	2.212685688813051
yes she called yesterday with her father	1.4529340654763856
what an agreeable man sir william is mr	1.3123106194971617
bingley is not he so much the man of fashion so genteel and so easy he has always something to say to every body	3.7028137966678956
that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter	1.6556946118646192
did charlotte dine with you no she would go home	2.4068435099910777
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies	1.3414558844121822
for my part mr	1
bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently	2.684180854015822
but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you	3.267464338278311
lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty	2.40914362922325
i do not trust my own partiality	2.539800060494732
but however he did not	1
perhaps he thought her too young	1.2954365800453846
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently	1.1881364005421737
there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way	1.9878138561399696
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy	2.344450934104934
of a fine stout healthy love it may	1.053177900553277
every thing nourishes what is strong already	1.2076420186384855
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again	1.4617102455718496
she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs	4.373987633441642
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr	1.0960945308527046
bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy	5.225687331941464
bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required	1.715167090236846
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs	1.3908732543757618
bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage	1.875576340336022
upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward	1.789064732927397
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr	2.1631654042625317
bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield	2.7533653377861746
lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age	1.5609408898552402
she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance	2.1322800854244863
she was very equal therefore to address mr	3.0026028853841993
bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it	2.847814991506152
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear	2.1776347256086517
i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball	2.6077931860983434
oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again	2.7623927952810763
and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also	1.9265676006678798
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	2.4425694006979914
bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr	2.28234862433558
darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on fine eyes	2.113628727737267
chapter x	1
the day passed much as the day before had done	2.8974044560030903
the loo table however did not appear	1.7613548046329697
hurst and mr	1
bingley were at piquet and mrs	1.0380068087822796
hurst was observing their game	1
elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion	1.2328220856579966
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each	1.9175878670974182
how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter he made no answer	4.093185867335912
you write uncommonly fast	1
you are mistaken	1
i write rather slowly	1
how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year letters of business too how odious i should think them it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours	2.4616249539596176
i have already told her so once by your desire	1.3484029110042306
i am afraid you do not like your pen	2.229147102127979
let me mend it for you	1.2213310631112433
i mend pens remarkably well	1
thank you but i always mend my own	1.7275724563119317
how can you contrive to write so even he was silent	2.1471644665046066
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s	2.990869788964843
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice	2.348976222149098
oh it is of no consequence	1.4040382661572264
i shall see her in january	1.398412784802521
but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr	1.9690102684729889
darcy they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine	2.357445445420904
it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill	2.891397909903575
he studies too much for words of four syllables	1.2070674282475944
do not you darcy my style of writing is very different from yours	1.7462427418449908
oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable	1.279195952430041
he leaves out half his words and blots the rest	1.259487986878258
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents	2.48767142570517
bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof	1.069643383321532
it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast	1.8002239651605167
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting	1.6847901613690281
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance	1.7093921419625075
when you told mrs	1
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning	1.997466989567665
and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment	2.753328556489935
at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	3.033355671910827
i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity	3.726212166245251
you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr	1.2829974532033366
bingley did not do justice to his own disposition	3.616751744947691
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper	2.5501173176829104
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could	3.2539402234412353
would mr	1
darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself	2.300207269327929
you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged	2.2621056089536897
allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety	2.8920560838546048
to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you	3.117595357249993
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either	2.29367407829535
you appear to me mr	1
darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection	1.5398272958860437
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it	1.738993799524219
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr	3.401258461631941
bingley	1
we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon	1.6674334449214843
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference	3.6937441301412126
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do	3.111702942315708
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense	2.370732525208054
i see your design bingley said his friend	1.6923161354200684
you dislike an argument and want to silence this	1.4174811561133105
perhaps i do	1
arguments are too much like disputes	1.044441485114371
what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr	2.9631595352809623
darcy had much better finish his letter	1.40809746985048
darcy took her advice and did finish his letter	3.1011487129843713
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself	2.336294614563077
hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr	2.6119830021805543
darcy s eyes were fixed on her	1.3244939349354092
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange	3.8476607314223332
the supposition did not pain her	1.3310883721202589
she liked him too little to care for his approbation	1.6095733524930464
after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr	1.4849870502739115
darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel she smiled but made no answer	2.82379738055993
he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence	2.715465673358869
oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply	5.221174511992509
you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt	2.523244789554026
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare	3.3871300466231204
indeed i do not dare	1
elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her	2.3327252455909546
he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger	3.373726127233161
miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth	1.828966597394607
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	1.7278195639733767
and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses	1.8261025041163408
have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity oh yes	1.3774814800847999
do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley	2.341230575428216
put them next to your great uncle the judge	1.3290089899800384
they are in the same profession you know only in different lines	4.112958050327227
as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied	2.6234530197821777
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs	2.824120264228758
hurst and elizabeth herself	1
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard	3.965002079824991
you used us abominably ill answered mrs	1.0904640641890713
hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out	1.844320548867537
then taking the disengaged arm of mr	1.020055201799886
darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself	4.321152189908665
the path just admitted three	1
darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party	1.5721333253490573
we had better go into the avenue	2.021032172809369
but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are	2.472261644690426
you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage	1.0345129207591455
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth	1.018067760781055
good bye	1
she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two	2.445005582151267
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	1.900659862680702
when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	3.1519161780371605
their powers of conversation were considerable	1.7912430599655205
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit	1.834964100234243
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object	2.3479635714008906
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr	2.7906087859061595
hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation	2.4437056229328307
he was full of joy and attention	1.1002189441762964
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door	2.6158818174312417
he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else	2.1932850261871293
elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight	1.873426314791176
when tea was over mr	1
hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain	2.613363927771233
hurst soon found even his open petition rejected	1.0897011365301195
hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep	2.146504253266681
darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs	2.721796240174442
hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet	2.0760898314466494
she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on	2.9578970845633195
at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library	2.994872928484563
no one made any reply	1
she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure	2.2218377169565873
if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards	2.277253617593884
i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting	1.8009759460247694
much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball	2.0066375370728036
her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious	2.0313408847382357
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room	1.717400876076335
i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude	2.230105872136794
elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately	2.277085876497238
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr	4.210179460125153
darcy looked up	1
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book	1.6772128278791778
he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere	2.5591632395971735
what could he mean she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it	3.184180950676347
miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr	1.6666843720665836
darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives	2.6748400106265526
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak	3.5360435233215757
you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire	2.1227512568328595
oh shocking cried miss bingley	1
i never heard any thing so abominable	1.4627138014380767
we can all plague and punish one another	1.0647706844479816
teaze him laugh at him	1
intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done	2.755063079193723
but upon my honour i do not	1.444147645752439
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that	1.4214034809712472
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there	1.767454797492569
and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject	2.174857269107715
darcy may hug himself	1
darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth	2.0385651670660185
that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance	2.9480370707360586
i dearly love a laugh	1
miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be	2.7061327943686138
the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke	2.7933309558688983
certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of them	3.41678594960466
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good	1.3206092538904979
follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can	2.077600041912381
perhaps that is not possible for any one	2.7456967637039558
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule	2.59068456525685
such as vanity and pride	1
but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation	1.8512623356292233
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	1.0969572221569002
your examination of mr	1
darcy has no defect	1
he owns it himself without disguise	1.020798494996713
i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding	2.033139702463931
my temper i dare not vouch for	1.9127536558821976
it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world	1.4358911057326267
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself	1.6363439662263772
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them	1.0953126891261573
my temper would perhaps be called resentful	1.68419537810336
my good opinion once lost is lost for ever	1.2260110741434038
that is a failing indeed cried elizabeth	1.4768457209856678
implacable resentment is a shade in a character	1.1792517810502416
but you have chosen your fault well	1.3216484393660848
i really cannot laugh at it	1.068632626884244
there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome	2.0525892317888883
and your defect is a propensity to hate every body	1.0651892186260639
and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them	1.8288274282864998
do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share	3.110058067582252
louisa you will not mind my waking mr	1.2800058004243808
hurst	1
her sister made not the smallest objection and the piano forte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it	1.5861529004314525
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention	2.8464832013847543
chapter xii	1
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day	3.6386267494302986
but mrs	1
bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish jane s week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before	2.413894331963994
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr	3.616232914678777
bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well	2.765498281806064
against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr	1.6550247926965478
bingley s carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made	1.839435872861275
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred	3.512628898682984
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other	2.8510974537571876
to mr	1
darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough	2.301672931796803
she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself	3.175397770459639
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it	1.7866005413671708
steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her	2.6721260076560904
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place	1.4154038859850637
miss bingley s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former	3.6328269364927332
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits	3.410593098758079
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	1.540497204579858
bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again	1.9054278794799566
the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth	2.3613030462784024
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort	2.648502039760665
much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married	2.4842869201093216
chapter xiii	1
i hope my dear said mr	1.6537667625493495
bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner to day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party	5.128859984219208
who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her	2.6711504254126943
i do not believe she often sees such at home	1.9900526506566698
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger	2.7055645642366377
bennet s eyes sparkled	1
bingley i am sure	1
bingley	1
but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to day	1.9327629741290029
lydia my love ring the bell	1.0671200507112457
it is not mr	1
bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life	3.7733247836047004
this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	2.7552982787391223
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained	3.945466919340019
about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention	2.848124629069904
it is from my cousin mr	2.822581520412475
oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned	2.3230937691533002
pray do not talk of that odious man	1.4966492091575405
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it	3.267802024108992
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs	3.0541802009446513
bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	2.8630230003396275
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr	1.5470989760528422
bennet and nothing can clear mr	1.142068803496129
collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn	1.3814306718271974
but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself	2.468966686563327
no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical	5.2424505372997885
i hate such false friends	1
dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance	2.563400101839019
there mrs	1
bennet	1
my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england	2.1016396908406745
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter	2.428227275141283
i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well wisher and friend william collins	1.4033827431509718
he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again	2.5519290824974616
there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him	2.9362061385086244
though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit	2.3161861440589653
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required	1.8616876554013075
he must be an oddity i think said she	1.505012020887937
i cannot make him out	1
there is something very pompous in his style	1.558140337196515
and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could	2.086934246606427
can he be a sensible man sir no my dear i think not	2.852224192156077
there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well	2.6169373925517223
i am impatient to see him	1.6101447231278756
in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective	1.6340411718709171
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed	2.2044525615988038
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting	2.175484597993261
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	3.086250706962208
as for their mother mr	1
collins s letter had done away much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters	3.3293334092323317
bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr	2.556185628435698
collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself	1.4445938905863573
he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty	2.710033351397956
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs	2.154779809055245
bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	2.5785954464681464
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs	2.458170183621868
bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough	2.188002507610621
things are settled so oddly	1
you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate	1.718728016207767
ah sir i do indeed	1
i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate	2.3991932646203034
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them	2.078835607748992
at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other	2.0629950691677124
they were not the only objects of mr	1.633594447229447
the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs	2.334126985828377
bennet s heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property	2.635714925128478
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing	1.7444747259917504
but here he was set right by mrs	1.7753536184492364
he begged pardon for having displeased her	1.0577875151269718
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour	2.15085024868025
chapter xiv	1
during dinner mr	1
bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness	2.4959001931187097
lady catherine de bourgh s attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable	2.6901754435396277
bennet could not have chosen better	2.6576247430030446
collins was eloquent in her praise	2.3150891126717994
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine	2.902547170770243
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening	2.5491762378175826
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her	2.1590370571957527
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations	2.840846658565388
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs	2.16885796884347
that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs	3.9720158433500856
bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman	2.5682905100335085
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her	1.967487523276427
does she live near you sir the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyship s residence	1.5803484320589734
i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property	3.2027992230859046
bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls	2.093893424537535
and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome she is a most charming young lady indeed	2.1646979318309976
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth	3.150723760486069
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them	1.8610780175258559
but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies	1.5494220235305312
has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court	3.499803253522249
her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament	1.762789647505481
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies	2.6977775406500086
i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her	2.0642005960672325
these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay	2.560137086227843
you judge very properly said mr	1.3301421393286685
bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy	2.4424289059621795
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure	2.1042145900182105
by tea time however the dose had been enough and mr	2.387699573397456
collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels	1.550022739317717
kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed	1.9700602497192816
other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyce s sermons	1.4306742714439802
lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him	2.1315214052484177
i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr	2.1700540934370536
denny comes back from town	1
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr	1.4135458361127986
but i will no longer importune my young cousin	2.5966250192215865
then turning to mr	1
bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon	1.218743706338505
bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements	1.7926985953790502
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia s interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr	2.1115880198762267
collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr	2.1233466239294585
bennet and prepared for backgammon	1
chapter xv	1
collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance	2.5872921517760044
the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity	2.2836552276900046
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility	3.021813277756895
having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	3.0823639549385717
this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father s estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part	1.7863278472330373
his plan did not vary on seeing them	1.607717413977165
the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hour s tête à tête with mrs	2.32228674879496
bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on	2.2274413657116474
as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged	4.430690339547073
collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs	4.3795683808724375
bennet was stirring the fire	1
elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course	1.7119886779883435
lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr	2.344866900122421
collins was to attend them at the request of mr	1.961945024065996
bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr	3.054614703398314
collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr	2.097442197523625
such doings discomposed mr	1
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr	2.421123433791756
collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr	5.534336443033432
collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go	1.6562579928898693
in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton	1.6642112997989986
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him	2.408122906854032
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them	2.2515932581962907
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentleman like appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way	3.2491068067489484
the officer was the very mr	1.279633154892708
denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed	2.3889629486469834
all were struck with the stranger s air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot	2.2161677321306414
wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps	4.131400579201158
this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming	3.6847605048955936
his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address	3.03633875482354
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street	2.311228951087155
on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities	2.391646826821867
he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her	5.9203656298167235
both changed colour one looked white the other red	1.0329484330048853
wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which mr	1.6166418823919155
darcy just deigned to return	1
what could be the meaning of it it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know	4.356083200770275
in another minute mr	1
bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend	1.2571132068178137
denny and mr	1
wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr	2.9430715697533194
philips s house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydia s pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs	3.1615766228779156
philips throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation	1.1362311710147763
philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr	3.0116593943669527
jones s shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr	3.0849236518691927
she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice	2.5674544059812554
philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr	2.650611546701009
denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenant s commission in the shire	3.2641779410542493
wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows	1.8910796630674211
some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr	3.7299563156990425
this was agreed to and mrs	1.945850859726852
the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits	1.50775038940642
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless	1.5395210809441748
as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister	2.7752473991165614
collins on his return highly gratified mrs	2.459419859209205
bennet by admiring mrs	1
philips s manners and politeness	1
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before	3.46246614580677
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life	2.5581809364344847
as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with their aunt and all mr	2.8439223529045683
collins s scruples of leaving mr	1.546692781719952
and mrs	1
bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that mr	2.2983502952618897
wickham had accepted their uncle s invitation and was then in the house	6.042291681836164
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr	1.8431291938009928
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs	2.4997360973540226
philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine s drawing rooms and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper s room	3.268445331346693
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs	2.1946580842806163
philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could	2.2840496305981777
it was over at last however	1.65823979462513
the gentlemen did approach and when mr	1.6170402426331947
wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration	2.8361985660596756
wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker	2.769222036496001
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr	1.9254684336706738
wickham and the officers mr	1
collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs	2.451459957954042
philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	1.4246849404150044
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist	2.280356507045147
philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason	2.0717952608921664
at first there seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular	2.311143494029939
allowing for the common demands of the game mr	1.6819952186792515
wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr	3.753114860365238
darcy	1
she dared not even mention that gentleman	1.9714598556523468
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved	1.1443164796722363
wickham began the subject himself	1
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long mr	1.8265042528854478
darcy had been staying there	1
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand	3.66372299662288
yes replied wickham his estate there is a noble one	2.069023529126512
a clear ten thousand per annum	1.0140359443799118
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	2.744413810131975
elizabeth could not but look surprised	2.717482550046226
are you much acquainted with mr	1.073010060814473
darcy as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable	3.2966732598844364
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise	2.318313223309809
i am not qualified to form one	3.2100210112449785
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge	3.461858105186534
it is impossible for me to be impartial	2.1074239606508876
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else	2.373568483179429
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire	2.521697983396249
every body is disgusted with his pride	1.0655855170192394
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one	1.6578105350984578
i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen	3.165178965788666
i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man	5.137756374722926
wickham only shook his head	1
i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield	3.827639670278101
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood	2.4496266358389778
oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr	1.7674514449576944
darcy	1
if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go	2.573584815990852
we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is	3.4279713674190515
his father miss bennet the late mr	1.3024805769458883
darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr	2.8116734917868067
darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections	1.5449452270098611
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father	2.2657403131371074
wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry	3.041012790618996
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire	1.706702471712667
i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them	2.982181282407537
society i own is necessary to me	1.605510432493417
i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude	3.5354831496786256
i must have employment and society	2.0119496950031706
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible	1.7868063941821004
the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now	4.076053217730286
darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift	1.4774516636212935
he was my godfather and excessively attached to me	1.2025016531571302
i cannot do justice to his kindness	1.5310672285795
he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere	3.0015055048327115
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr	4.5598860718705145
darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing	2.1312097007590567
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it	2.7433625368431094
i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely	3.2690736594378684
i can recal nothing worse	1
but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me	3.2554086335279915
this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced	1.2382302115898922
some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me	5.643618614083756
but what said she after a pause can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy	2.2942145614821476
had the late mr	1
darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life	2.37664293856499
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me	2.4354467091141565
i had not thought mr	1
darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper	2.4726206889282176
his disposition must be dreadful	1
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the god son the friend the favourite of his father she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care	2.569074528719511
my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr	2.856317151610095
philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr	2.748203988197253
darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property	2.747424311535704
he was most highly esteemed by mr	1.2593697020914216
darcy a most intimate confidential friend	1.070368430938925
darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendance and when immediately before my father s death mr	2.6721845549651944
darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself	2.7981489456636783
how strange cried elizabeth	1
how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr	2.4155672752753192
it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend	2.3534725218312076
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling	1.7164368737952402
but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride	1.9320894318807391
it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor	1.594700250110259
family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this	2.5300163320584077
not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive	2.113142986527893
what sort of a girl is miss darcy he shook his head	10.084411825959437
i wish i could call her amiable	1.563705241136883
but she is too much like her brother very very proud	3.6031352285621905
as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement	3.0268119831834603
but she is nothing to me now	2.395731939506034
she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished	3.4284733697794403
since her father s death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education	2.5220221877643243
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with mr	2.463690771659
bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr	1.8770797292338506
bingley not at all	1
he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man	1.5059533734927433
he cannot know what mr	1
darcy is	1
probably not but mr	1
darcy can please where he chuses	1.5807146276770967
he does not want abilities	1
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while	2.0477787466998345
his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure	1.3786149708596367
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr	1.6140246159892613
collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs	1.7379981174764738
philips	1
the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter	1.7345322889478543
it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs	4.378624094646876
philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy	2.3181157197861
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object	2.7241321558533476
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters	2.3818966565251767
wickham s attention was caught and after observing mr	1.619392395443605
collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh	2.3958726997446926
lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living	1.880879977799949
i hardly know how mr	1
collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long	2.5127127204055872
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr	2.501935987797023
darcy	1
no indeed i did not	1
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday	3.1639201640534425
her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates	3.3087968455879513
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley	1.6701778648649028
vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already self destined to another	3.1400673456818056
collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman	2.770755509192838
i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent	4.642562002051521
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr	2.6656491768765993
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs	1.8333993792697854
philips s supper party but his manners recommended him to every body	2.3168803313377615
whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully	1.3988896403359021
elizabeth went away with her head full of him	1.3480926643016713
she could think of nothing but of mr	2.4074544963684312
wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr	2.9393044703680116
collins were once silent	1
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr	2.1585996706619346
collins in describing the civility of mr	1.4531634433048894
and mrs	1
philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	2.1212341592362596
chapter xvii	1
elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr	2.859901308594624
wickham and herself	1
jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr	2.6475430230536956
darcy could be so unworthy of mr	1.6930138113320625
bingley s regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham	3.8695845148251666
they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea	2.820673550875894
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other	1.0821072694776845
it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side	1.8832941618629728
very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody	2.720839243617285
laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion	2.424127986317912
my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr	1.8104202490059007
darcy to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for	2.513405927636686
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no	1.4149395238436766
i can much more easily believe mr	1.0534208976806356
wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony	1.8054708799486459
if it be not so let mr	1.812830569141996
besides there was truth in his looks	1.577417631075098
one does not know what to think	1.7294439152501326
i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think	1.5274600116073904
but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr	2.546984182533705
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr	2.7752658225660447
bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday	3.2173169796303114
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation	2.8317672292351452
to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs	2.5924770919909927
bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others	2.546030645308182
they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs	1.5247252843007044
bennet s civilities	1
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family	2.4585630206049394
bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr	1.9945473975498917
bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card	1.6254822680008139
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr	4.268914507248824
wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr	3.048998913649443
darcy s looks and behaviour	1
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr	2.789374020988815
wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball	3.341492323978077
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it	1.9506004323372823
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough	2.7311526830584336
i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	2.6351095144490415
society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body	1.7268174724116923
elizabeth s spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr	3.4237307852828573
bingley s invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evening s amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance	3.2138102652748004
i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her	3.237956047892099
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in	1.0286222184156757
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr	2.803736664460787
collins instead her liveliness had been never worse timed	1.0632384267045587
there was no help for it however	2.1317895647280425
wickham s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and mr	2.72001157739054
collins s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could	1.517233823711089
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her	2.287301425277447
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply	2.1383455281552552
collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him	3.2406168383383736
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once	3.4899673402175555
no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy	1.4230478336912868
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr	2.0613554097135176
wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia	1.768928073863108
chapter xviii	1
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr	2.156796498693182
wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	1.785669134977274
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her	2.568775172872056
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr	1.9187102074970261
denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here	3.088797309638612
this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make	2.8537475841435884
attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham	1.0640562468378776
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr	3.7674662185271655
bingley whose blind partiality provoked her	1.003871341295865
but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice	3.0871032861176895
the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification	1.8832345124686898
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy	1.484754218855109
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked	2.4003415560763535
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr	1.8459759352582052
darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him	2.819732791877521
he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her	2.5606257252100435
i dare say you will find him very agreeable	4.917559811957825
heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil	1.7370125633778186
when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence	2.868324980725352
darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it	1.2874049603764592
he replied and was again silent	1.3572673593058187
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now mr	3.6536853717518145
darcy	1
i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples	1.9282160273888345
he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said	2.3340372348720004
very well	1
that reply will do for the present	1.3719489677760741
perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones	1.4984752558842467
but now we may be silent	2.0705424139357005
do you talk by rule then while you are dancing sometimes	1.3483382151282617
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible	2.6120745136434396
are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds	2.4631686158861896
we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb	1.3484153717984837
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he	2.6721866104642067
how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say	2.3557513649448794
you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly	1.4217890380017426
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton	4.092207733623481
she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance	2.0272857758819276
the effect was immediate	1
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on	2.732452154354388
at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr	2.6749402442075474
wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain	1.7152449475083005
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life	2.3901392618029305
darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject	1.7470479974382065
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr	3.779473762876271
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner	2.2574368350474163
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir	2.3069578219227456
such very superior dancing is not often seen	1.1058926430493037
it is evident that you belong to the first circles	1.2710144513448918
allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place	2.401543708772036
what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr	1.0972072524105136
darcy but let me not interrupt you sir	1.524437071122606
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me	1.3676613814406802
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together	2.29945794172317
recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	1.4736295128653112
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves	3.0320492526336214
we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine	2.1635502661621793
what think you of books said he smiling	1.5441726844911343
books oh no	1
i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject	2.192492322115888
we may compare our different opinions	1.4325731998370925
no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else	2.6172098705941793
the present always occupies you in such scenes does it said he with a look of doubt	2.172866825824979
darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable	1.1487130195975201
you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created	1.556049348690056
i am said he with a firm voice	1.4111286326645387
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first	1.7678887349590962
may i ask to what these questions tend merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity	1.824929987830985
i am trying to make it out	3.1444620622360926
and what is your success she shook her head	1.9414096835684715
i do not get on at all	2.4289965421670203
i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either	3.048243944783394
but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity	2.656948128749443
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied	1.77354245750861
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another	2.7384152489855267
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr	2.4364733220560204
darcy s steward	1
let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr	2.1401988650333217
darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr	2.3280044742596053
darcy in a most infamous manner	3.4768721162373564
i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr	2.5145688190060267
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it	2.9614462829703396
i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better	3.1635077244049783
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr	2.5512439549419303
darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself	2.5889980634169394
i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer	4.363496416663361
excuse my interference	1
it was kindly meant	1
insolent girl said elizabeth to herself	1.5159263168768804
you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this	1.5987697528679745
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr	1.7750719468573883
she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley	2.0028729616578738
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening	1.91983583185594
elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness	2.415445230164698
i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about mr	4.969963106243125
wickham	1
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon	2.510841087883134
no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you	3.0942295245766647
bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr	2.676443409805255
wickham has deserved much less attention from mr	1.9059627913890644
darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s mr	5.9322763066751705
wickham is by no means a respectable young man	1.4124090710359987
i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr	1.6490243231602237
darcy s regard	1
bingley does not know mr	1
darcy	1
i am perfectly satisfied	1
but what does he say of the living he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr	3.998854024156659
darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only	1.7862400659415574
bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only	1.9841488997952164
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it	1.8413715824069548
bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr	1.730891371852942
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness	2.7947931534309984
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine	4.3352793954129085
how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before	2.994602784075198
you are not going to introduce yourself to mr	1.9700919387326552
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier	1.7838813414706474
i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew	4.412864623894672
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night	4.043933732405236
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr	2.4054636435161134
darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr	2.8463643579135907
collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained	2.7528828116259665
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty	2.60240279461882
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself	2.212811839310245
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr	2.9900625931561042
darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident	1.3346573136996673
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh	2.4883044018107983
it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man	2.369428934782796
darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr	2.346023463290091
collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility	1.4642598599580963
collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr	1.861137186489244
darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way	2.7372384268458587
collins then returned to elizabeth	1
i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception	3.6745631801331453
darcy seemed much pleased with the attention	2.1938745513540097
he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily	2.5949930239592285
it was really a very handsome thought	1.4431596169137175
upon the whole i am much pleased with him	2.1494594045549045
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr	3.103064668539897
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters	2.8951752779990803
her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much	2.0246046156039506
when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr	2.8340454651953473
bingley	1
his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	3.031327149760552
it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	2.901621932837401
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life	2.3352540013664784
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it	1.4584737804519663
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr	2.293462478635297
darcy who sat opposite to them	1.1434395686413492
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical	1.0067212043701637
what is mr	1
for heaven s sake madam speak lower	1.0096895463328204
what advantage can it be to you to offend mr	2.055908284975403
darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing	3.954485034672603
nothing that she could say however had any influence	2.3136961510353258
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone	2.6282990331517655
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation	1.2203453987705626
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr	2.1422510198927096
darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her	2.446896168685198
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity	1.6464562927768776
at length however mrs	1
elizabeth now began to revive	1
by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song	2.2019948839176333
elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another	2.242979527672384
mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected	2.5668147664598506
elizabeth was in agonies	1
she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley	2.1800743805797818
he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child	1.3904715598377038
you have delighted us long enough	1.1578484805968985
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit	1.1245819872934721
others of the party were now applied to	2.5407482509985315
if i said mr	1
collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman	2.354234242552326
i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to	2.265928831135824
the rector of a parish has much to do	5.66007474795387
in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron	2.8584751709608165
he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible	2.9308124864343763
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment	2.279882008938308
i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family	1.7569461521614862
and with a bow to mr	2.8290919178906715
darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room	2.595388846148543
many stared	1
many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr	1.5423577768445613
bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr	1.779149327609456
collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man	1.9763082971613561
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed	3.787589548572667
that his two sisters and mr	1.3871639172224797
darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable	2.885751465191842
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement	3.9083869388100076
she was teazed by mr	1
collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others	2.731842292666793
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room	1.7997138967472686
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening	3.6092014279398437
there was no arguing upon such a project	1.7378750786959536
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged mr	2.6696830391381106
collins s conversation to herself	1
she was at least free from the offence of mr	2.8888123063842177
darcy s farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak	1.6175620901627734
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr	2.3869449502572513
wickham and rejoiced in it	1
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of mrs	2.371745066199247
bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family	2.4689508526078137
hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves	2.3642665722874425
bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr	2.8164334275245166
collins who was complimenting mr	1
bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests	2.6584695268089757
darcy said nothing at all	1
bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene	1.3255220749995904
bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other	1.6282373231913492
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs	2.777139769355762
hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn	1.3553619505388477
when at length they arose to take leave mrs	4.089105089089784
bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr	1.9900136692745287
bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time	2.41039179179928
collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure	1.534414847169446
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr	4.552370646591193
bingley and netherfield	1
chapter xix	1
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn	2.8370305008534857
collins made his declaration in form	1.1188113746284274
having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business	3.3799452560923924
on finding mrs	1
bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mrs	3.6750665664720388
bennet instantly answered oh dear yes certainly	1.7885341699424355
come kitty i want you up stairs	1.1532993591199965
and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear ma am do not go	1.520684202601167
i beg you will not go	2.788672304463793
collins must excuse me	1
he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear	2.8212186443205733
i am going away myself	1
and upon elizabeth s seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr	1.2504384173862593
collins	1
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion	2.1335906892038623
bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr	2.748467535054201
collins began	1
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address	2.7032845156862995
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken	2.078113052857058
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life	3.1154393922116483
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did	2.6977602690952738
the idea of mr	1
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs	2.279993406584439
jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said mr	1.7168447115914405
collins you must marry	1
chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way	1.909106371423267
this is my advice	1
find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her	5.895250648602467
allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer	3.8194083210313545
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite	2.3719124552326543
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women	2.301242663645266
but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years	2.72404081186821
this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem	3.230928131732096
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection	2.0581107706160204
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the <num> per cents	3.5086405298336456
which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to	2.794395214667164
on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	2.1317996018455947
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	1.2286431764181784
you are too hasty sir she cried	1.415078022956887
you forget that i have made no answer	3.835345967813945
let me do it without farther loss of time	1.543807764293498
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me	3.5433296823682157
i am not now to learn replied mr	3.1419534553413455
collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time	2.8820433728150383
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration	1.5056364919161973
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time	1.955147098439127
i am perfectly serious in my refusal	1.75445980669322
you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so	5.860395267776874
nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation	2.950249388251406
were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr	2.3112540460337088
collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you	2.3359480609301295
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications	4.122909559887172
indeed mr	1
collins all praise of me will be unnecessary	1.5342286504377622
you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say	2.7999224346511613
i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise	2.6300636632521983
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach	2.852275857872396
this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled	1.2176034156333184
really mr	1
collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly	1.2031800338862702
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one	2.6950132866847767
you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course	2.222927454254429
my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable	2.46516929794696
my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you	2.7276679419206156
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications	1.7270693522870486
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females	2.5674928844231992
i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man	1.9905519183802947
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere	1.9995387500308603
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible	3.5259237741429734
my feelings in every respect forbid it	1.9005264944036147
can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart	1.6541373339946357
you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable	2.3159625888613053
to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	1.945517567043067
chapter xx	1
collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs	1.7740034727266252
bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection	2.0140577636193946
this information however startled mrs	1
bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so	3.3849296841461687
but depend upon it mr	1
collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason	2.013895968007374
i will speak to her about it myself directly	2.868195987815957
she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it	3.118925095748653
pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr	1.9673866243507574
collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state	2.706891916007851
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity	1.9852503945005586
sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs	1.181178170107626
bennet alarmed	1
lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these	1.6624951583290408
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived	3.5024077604735036
i will go directly to mr	1.531184033778002
bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure	2.5372899067728554
she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh mr	2.848757035104472
bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar	1.9512883946634363
you must come and make lizzy marry mr	2.147103511372052
collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her	3.122511718339198
bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication	2.09577651606193
of what are you talking of mr	3.717307026788406
collins and lizzy	1
lizzy declares she will not have mr	1.7429837055389605
collins and mr	1
collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy	3.8597667979309884
and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business	2.449216113079658
speak to lizzy about it yourself	1.1469836845218921
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him	1.1676943033994909
let her be called down	1
she shall hear my opinion	1
come here child cried her father as she appeared	1.5088987453760156
i have sent for you on an affair of importance	2.4011000235193563
i understand that mr	1
collins has made you an offer of marriage	2.09177817570405
is it true elizabeth replied that it was	1.874010489053244
very well and this offer of marriage you have refused i have sir	3.3718289510531796
very well	1
we now come to the point	3.2131208570641823
your mother insists upon your accepting it	1.0905239156432318
is not it so mrs	1
bennet yes or i will never see her again	1.9129558149304804
an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth	1.2420056618366397
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents	4.476203508591829
collins and i will never see you again if you do	2.3806998097939203
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs	5.030949877908834
bennet by talking in this way you promised me to insist upon her marrying him	1.5349966068239789
my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request	2.6345946965010123
first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room	1.9195291102354415
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be	2.7791939322551724
not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs	3.3854440239395176
bennet give up the point	1
she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns	2.574581190327838
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	1.5374449486662818
though her manner varied however her determination never did	2.67716217854895
collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	1.0585845449054652
his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret	2.1787797958005752
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them	2.8616674996191267
she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr	2.448163777392552
collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him	4.216991262918863
charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where mrs	2.475795922333151
bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family	3.5333390501934754
pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves	2.451700692176528
bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way	1.8681102243320342
but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead	3.0904438219711325
i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word	4.446746908895036
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children	3.985587812711507
not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body	3.143944859975755
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking	1.8506626978040404
nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so	2.459550661167593
those who do not complain are never pitied	1.3082872352566182
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation	1.4109794512582958
she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr	2.885810587707892
collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr	2.777469262392782
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr	2.9528975540491196
collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear	2.39731636294759
in a doleful voice mrs	1
bennet thus began the projected conversation	1.4291473630320528
oh mr	1
collins my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point	1.4947495669910809
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned	2.553856444552566
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation	1.9485703949729043
bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf	1.7667819788850274
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own	1.9985985561451602
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair	2.341483313647024
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise	2.9961041907551627
the discussion of mr	1
as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence	1.9527998103618682
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs	2.145512680599209
collins was also in the same state of angry pride	2.621921073144169
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it	2.985445726135101
after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr	1.8119588031101794
wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball	1.8771690140475528
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over	3.699963800510215
to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed	2.194875193702423
i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr	2.7489325686252433
darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself	4.836865831523191
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her	2.496271685069944
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	2.55314318776083
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady s fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	1.7803928329093253
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs	2.2687752619094117
when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal	2.9801740980347415
the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again	5.1027478563059345
you shall hear what she says	2.1738291336780518
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr	3.4657546565726114
hurst had a house	1
the next was in these words	1.4219653843034423
i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence	2.8466884668880676
i depend on you for that	1.7709877772213152
to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr	2.7667947931461385
bingley s being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his	3.074445476118313
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country	3.306405452519663
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr	1.9345665142915254
bingley will not be detained in london by them	2.24868399045091
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair	2.9670860376306774
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you	1.8406187967709755
it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter	1.4027838854603938
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should	4.492192818091788
he is his own master	1
but you do not know all	2.3082608989756475
i will have no reserves from you	2.5000373825826725
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable	3.6376810426478916
my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister s partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart	2.554377671790906
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy said jane as she finished it	2.336035352590678
is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject yes there can for mine is totally different	3.3680102925025843
will you hear it most willingly	1.1111315197163747
you shall have it in few words	1.4974542069088004
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy	2.9224939970509656
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you	1.9409483849641336
jane shook her head	1
indeed jane you ought to believe me	1.7564989164912677
no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection	2.8966259176045375
miss bingley i am sure cannot	3.0923948959777428
she is not such a simpleton	3.457066690295215
could she have seen half as much love in mr	2.9337355057459296
darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes	3.299125754614748
we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way	2.7206674313919015
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy	2.1930048758768064
but i know the foundation is unjust	1.8364764483258047
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself	2.500727424024398
that is right	1
you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine	2.4545418663654233
believe her to be deceived by all means	1.4973099761459048
you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer	2.769398651518595
how can you talk so said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate	3.1088320775001472
i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion	3.1892070007696742
but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required	1.7886567764000858
a thousand things may arise in six months the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt	1.7593065526991636
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one	2.107060872164438
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	4.5581967009065485
jane s temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	2.5508629855022074
they agreed that mrs	1
bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together	2.5295400414031057
after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr	2.07782613984071
bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses	2.549810830526797
chapter xxii	1
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr	4.052317357376318
collins	1
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her	1.7952498192894046
it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express	2.9447944783249733
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time	3.173136043901864
this was very amiable but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr	2.017199952659059
collins s addresses by engaging them towards herself	1.8274396691509331
such was miss lucas s scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon	2.5264688223756333
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet	2.098951466090526
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday	2.1992492540291506
his reception however was of the most flattering kind	1.4629856557554661
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane	1.8144019415702815
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	1.5964268304269589
in as short a time as mr	1.9361239195137399
collins s long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness	3.554985580031782
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained	1.715469431770197
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity	2.3886487198953925
collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair	2.5960384495392095
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr	1.6655639365256267
bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr	2.310792555019776
collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st	3.6962159486538475
james s	1
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion	2.3808272708082088
the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid	1.7887775605594094
charlotte herself was tolerably composed	1
she had gained her point and had time to consider of it	3.4369541905897796
her reflections were in general satisfactory	1.9743372992433814
collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary	2.0097285797322377
but still he would be her husband	4.6543030952030024
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want	2.0096517394321323
this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it	1.937860870911501
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person	2.7446379931205875
elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation	1.625537954840208
she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr	1.8429258153091446
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	2.095808567682146
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs	3.2293468112848265
bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them	3.7712777271185662
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible	2.983912854866331
they were all astonished and mr	3.2573248576080185
my dear sir replied mr	1
you cannot be too much on your guard	2.1874999663964
risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence	3.047635982469246
believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire	2.3047116702377117
as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth	3.1196073188138556
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return	1.6291977587536273
bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	2.9498353871326466
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her s he might become a very agreeable companion	2.4387934939168128
but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away	3.5257583545416384
miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before	2.991393121687949
the possibility of mr	1
collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mr	2.628588677262953
collins my dear charlotte impossible the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible that mr	2.400340972074614
collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness	2.9878151587257826
i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr	2.135573075061947
collins was wishing to marry you	2.2565341823349803
but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done	3.3411888307740107
i am not romantic you know	2.054142719276449
i never was	1
i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr	1.36501169146284
collins s character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state	2.4889283856218287
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family	1.8497965814307225
charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard	2.327619273746306
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match	2.648675276410518
the strangeness of mr	1
collins s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted	1.5546836707899296
she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage	2.483809716157765
charlotte the wife of mr	1
collins was a most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen	2.138809092597097
chapter xxiii	1
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family	2.6650912663696076
with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs	2.7730430492952314
bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know that mr	1.7866068680724128
collins wants to marry lizzy nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir william s good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy	1.903022104701282
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr	2.5175881015794586
collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london	2.0217245641327835
bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent	1.7303140333664002
in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr	3.7096445783963308
nor did that day wear out her resentment	1.0337486027669798
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter	3.6413628555750432
bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	3.1030431552199986
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr	3.2416654774243847
collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton	1.9834674081236523
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs	1.9554492946739477
bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs	2.517814939664458
bennet s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away	1.804763369210508
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return	2.2867430905828345
the promised letter of thanks from mr	2.076191038626862
collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth s abode in the family might have prompted	2.310626671750077
after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men	2.6140180557342907
collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs	3.050534252225607
bennet	1
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband	3.019419690081804
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome	3.5599221818483833
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs	1.1081758510885253
bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr	2.2341611373476766
bingley s continued absence	1
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject	1.5137379662349058
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs	2.212342998273937
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane s happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring	2.25360382042673
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment	3.1026447836590707
as for jane her anxiety under this suspence was of course more painful than elizabeth s but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to	2.320464325604493
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used	1.9781639019795543
it needed all jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity	1.191319868257626
collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction	2.3689665884216216
he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company	3.239017570810052
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed	4.567720135418111
bennet was really in a most pitiable state	2.3057408337964507
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	1.9056777511008736
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her	4.003771657428686
as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence	1.3951730637900748
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr	2.6545618394093182
collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr	2.9331246360177543
bennet were dead	1
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband	2.0130339293660042
indeed mr	1
bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts	3.3641537826422665
let us hope for better things	6.921939435955668
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor	9.125078369935842
this was not very consoling to mrs	1.4739323007367824
bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate	2.653365228773746
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it	3.5577035853329058
what should not you mind i should not mind any thing at all	2.1923315343723146
bennet for any thing about the entail	2.2181004934569484
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr	4.121493405249611
collins too why should he have it more than anybody else i leave it to yourself to determine said mr	2.215284395764884

chapter i	1
miss bingley s letter arrived and put an end to doubt	3.207392371405558
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort	2.7879621666502654
miss darcy s praise occupied the chief of it	1.6710392763147424
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate of mr	3.2426151361553055
darcy s house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture	1.8801294152171082
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation	2.134912243805483
her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others	2.118746336933057
to caroline s assertion of her brother s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit	2.3040017849821393
that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations	2.749434345884262
had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best but her sister s was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself	2.64246142915512
she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingley s regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of jane s attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sister s situation remained the same her peace equally wounded	2.6186810991678597
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs	3.675327763432505
bennet s leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	2.755467263210472
but i will not repine	1
it cannot last long	1
he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before	1.7357730971862508
you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason	1.477262092830543
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all	2.319838847169808
i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with	2.1355663850112903
thank god i have not that pain	2.548430329648618
a little time therefore	1
i shall certainly try to get the better	2.136077140554204
with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself	3.512780139210068
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you	1.8652361688151322
i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve	2.315581228896243
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sister s warm affection	2.0405221449212143
nay said elizabeth this is not fair	1.3710193230823582
you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body	2.1076300731023077
i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it	1.533943077719009
do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will	1.2658927923959495
you need not	1
there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well	1.7062361701224418
the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense	2.090548274046909
i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlotte s marriage	1.6013407966022817
it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these	2.3914986182338853
they will ruin your happiness	1
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper	2.5129908897561157
collins s respectability and charlotte s prudent steady character	1.079918432363448
remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every body s sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin	3.9299789701544525
to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart	2.8298789522373777
my dear jane mr	1
collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking	2.7089077168092808
you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas	3.044151296593684
you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness	1.9124473849121615
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together	2.134757275455863
but enough of this	1
you alluded to something else	1
you mentioned two instances	1
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured	2.390404590123001
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect	2.4960547409099205
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us	1.884407377948325
and men take care that they should	1.1929531055762628
if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine	2.862678248892594
bingley s conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery	2.2018183148632717
thoughtlessness want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business	2.6970833013160354
and do you impute it to either of those yes to the last	2.167229909416129
but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem	2.6326013655831453
stop me whilst you can	1
you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him	1.0890517041177088
yes in conjunction with his friend	1.0771382287369433
i cannot believe it	1
why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it	2.6552072821727593
your first position is false	1
they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride	2.534739027752373
beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing	2.872522047671382
they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better	2.47719280872738
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed	2.082004396453821
do not distress me by the idea	2.219131281649866
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters	3.304950049194495
let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood	3.4761167695696154
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr	2.2548738930825727
bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them	2.232291510418536
bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity	2.6387075072181054
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day	3.1756724026216627
bennet s best comfort was that mr	1.0493961604938964
bingley must be down again in the summer	2.6792397099355068
bennet treated the matter differently	1
so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find	2.381971582045882
i congratulate her	1
next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then	1.9923164043446255
it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions	2.3240036154521815
when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane	2.9477596010459375
now is your time	1
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country	2.03638703584288
let wickham be your man	1
he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably	1.514044164226504
thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me	1.6946276913524696
true said mr	1
bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it	3.305760358168823
wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family	1.983628032058446
they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve	2.195790549092208
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr	5.077842129642921
darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr	2.432148852717095
darcy before they had known any thing of the matter	2.076951296926374
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr	1.9696754743007927
darcy was condemned as the worst of men	1.5929536496861512
chapter ii	1
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr	1.5910275882131402
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday	3.427155059439954
the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men	2.8146089390004483
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks	2.8846736642965602
on the following monday mrs	1
bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn	2.6554818299663627
gardiner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education	2.8218278786831505
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable	2.457676859762686
gardiner who was several years younger than mrs	1.8885072407241055
bennet and mrs	1
philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces	1.796965534835776
between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard	1.5215817631101929
the first part of mrs	1
gardiner s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions	1.8007169603291062
when this was done she had a less active part to play	3.0440089916774804
it became her turn to listen	1.2625266990774922
bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of	1.2747109096124831
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it	3.7374574047780307
i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr	4.1628958449128834
bingley if she could	1
but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr	2.590040987336169
collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness	3.0630328181617905
he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him	2.07722614021954
the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever	4.487110617449443
the lucases are very artful people indeed sister	1.1945443085833147
they are all for what they can get	3.80272685328845
i am sorry to say it of them but so it is	3.030260750271211
however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves	2.2186042149436047
gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation	2.595965506029851
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject	2.781280615694844
i am sorry it went off	1.7004278762894798
but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr	2.0519516830891074
bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent	2.191371193306018
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us	2.65304054233966
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before	3.5559838552108523
but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea	1.7485959315227158
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment	1.697726383730177
pray how violent was mr	1
bingley s love i never saw a more promising inclination	3.5667473506314615
he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her	1.194794986262586
every time they met it was more decided and remarkable	2.4583293786610665
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer	2.233645307504369
could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt	2.232950868178095
poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately	4.727717203676648
it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner	1.8679612156993042
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything	2.289444025119317
i hope added mrs	1
gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her	2.1013699632277287
and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr	2.376117665003221
darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr	2.676740538124947
bingley never stirs without him	1
so much the better	1
but does not jane correspond with the sister she will not be able to help calling	4.7628687184095595
she will drop the acquaintance entirely	1.3617820830613683
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless	2.6780552027239257
it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions	1.9946497231893965
miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him	3.4272017173184812
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement	4.836010226398095
wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs	2.6582976296041387
gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both	1.751674944614742
without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment	3.2621904880473265
to mrs	1
gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers	1.5562282410343113
about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged	2.838274768466909
they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring	4.013952366642747
gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr	3.838859387776548
darcy by character perfectly well	1
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse	1.2516128700412847
in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself	2.0391317353284566
on being made acquainted with the present mr	1.949494345728659
fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy	1.7605057904114483
chapter iii	1
gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly	2.166748867823639
seriously i would have you be on your guard	5.73543053562932
do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent	3.038114892387163
i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better	6.139905087020729
but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you	2.2222290193431813
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure	1.8911173226098137
you must not disappoint your father	2.378595207426406
yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise	2.5508911807147636
well then you need not be under any alarm	2.1138835338242346
wickham too	1
he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it	4.194778880256272
elizabeth you are not serious now	2.5100883377238885
i beg your pardon	1
i will try again	1
at present i am not in love with mr	3.6009596788320866
wickham no i certainly am not	1.094715430671873
but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not	3.4079865991921787
i see the imprudence of it	2.3552671074227196
oh that abominable mr	1
darcy my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it	3.524197355831109
my father however is partial to mr	1.8407452658079635
wickham	1
in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry	2.5814561171047914
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object	4.033913719049048
when i am in company with him i will not be wishing	4.695848809957775
in short i will do my best	1.8734834831443528
perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often	2.8368613535514795
at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him	1.6204671815618195
as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that	3.6228518421130973
but do not imagine that he is always here so often	4.467997319553671
but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied	3.167213891000881
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented	2.75182468913062
bennet	1
his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she wished they might be happy	2.555412210475173
thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother s ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room	2.233826772314039
as they went down stairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza	1.4147444305162635
that you certainly shall	1
and i have another favour to ask	3.086461223586084
will you come and see me we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire	2.9063307816552784
i am not likely to leave kent for some time	2.9202824179030467
promise me therefore to come to hunsford	2.113122521496493
my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party	4.6415973817154486
indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them	1.7059366866336128
the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual	3.1058497365326363
she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise	1.5369006037821749
the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and obliging	2.031922035511151
collins s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest	2.227818581628182
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys	3.470834577366851
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is	1.4242068650703863
jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline	2.8966167693932645
my aunt she continued is going to morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street	4.05269687343823
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley	3.216578948708151
i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her	1.9014625590908816
i enquired after their brother of course	1.4503808493992953
he was well but so much engaged with mr	1.927894380722551
darcy that they scarcely ever saw him	1.4568222585023372
i wish i could see her	2.7065757335548133
my visit was not long as caroline and mrs	1.6222815249892941
hurst were going out	1
i dare say i shall soon see them here	4.033850066665465
elizabeth shook her head over this letter	1.7788957420317664
it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr	1.6157538484004978
bingley her sister s being in town	2.362305399681105
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley s inattention	4.090510988242649
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer	2.7026858020281126
my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley s regard for me	2.6083118489294312
but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion	2.230794781059203
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time	2.4595870195224285
when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer	3.443970912725418
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side	2.5083118050131668
but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it	2.9932428008993317
i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable	1.937983112574559
he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy	3.3179007483779577
i cannot understand it	1
if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this	1.9764851510802772
let me hear from you very soon	1.7234849673253467
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty	2.5574723805536825
we had better not mention it	2.927762475767849
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford	2.2548719385737583
pray go to see them with sir william and maria	2.5584205387327312
i am sure you will be very comfortable there	4.221713626917373
your s c	1
this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least	2.3955701100239573
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over	2.2288340239649878
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions	2.1175544924243583
his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr	2.020225491032686
darcy s sister as by wickham s account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away	4.300635389049529
gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	2.4363789433755416
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain	2.6304158507409805
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte s did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	2.2959311867999097
all this was acknowledged to mrs	2.8417275298266267
gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil	3.6294857412498063
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king	2.8269190329180263
i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl	3.927767748078793
there can be no love in all this	3.2516389663566936
my watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance	2.3344792257943783
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do	2.7427254151506406
they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain	2.2373937175962952
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away	1.5259792335584939
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford	2.8422966393157374
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr	1.7179022757084443
collins	1
there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	2.7013619646819853
every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlotte s first sketch	2.352545698099407
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter	2.44314402183529
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be	1.622095191572219
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter	2.9686796367327557
wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more	3.0864399958112307
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing	2.685780129319168
her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable	3.9777334017165806
sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good humoured girl but as empty headed as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise	2.045715719105767
elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir william s too long	2.791239133502353
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information	1.364202067157629
it was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon	3.4279714785003446
gardiner s door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever	1.9098271603003043
all was joy and kindness	1
the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres	2.752368481353866
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt	1.4072621198993718
their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection	2.2304241495997825
it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long	3.6157310671254637
gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley s visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance	2.350762646421219
gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well	1.4003494169093864
but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary	2.950939197045118
pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary	2.600833487935875
if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think	3.7804971658089817
she is a very good kind of girl i believe	2.9616982829605853
i know no harm of her	1.2161730043488395
but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune	1.8771124390487188
no why should he if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event	2.6072208184005707
if she does not object to it why should we her not objecting does not justify him	1.9498051527226423
it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling	1.0295164915915724
well cried elizabeth have it as you choose	1.6143176586496149
he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish	2.3641768923600974
no lizzy that is what i do not choose	2.7569663894781
i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire	3.0684298321833894
oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better	3.3744857931418153
i am sick of them all	1.0711781509708296
thank heaven i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him	3.163431646985438
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all	1.1277393633001878
take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment	1.1703315815849693
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer	3.0946105145319773
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs	3.6763452403307135
gardiner but perhaps to the lakes	1.7804370332751163
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful	3.557595171911225
my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour	1.2808427740455413
adieu to disappointment and spleen	1
what are men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing	1.6770132522382641
we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen	1.7181235808023514
lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation	1.575549966470366
chapter v	1
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view	3.3143968364795664
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side	2.1119846341668067
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants	2.562542983558254
at length the parsonage was discernible	1.8185127306249702
collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received	3.307886407212845
she saw instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family	2.7868120448487717
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him	2.4378990269976195
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion	2.641215831154795
when mr	1
collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte	1.6755437683460996
once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear	1.3264781829970789
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr	2.6235883304341034
collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself	1.9351902532801675
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible	2.129450895448537
here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind	1.4129232438367458
he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump	2.3264075409925242
but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house	2.5042901916413447
it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground	1.4620844785710128
from his garden mr	1
collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband s help	2.2369586746439047
when mr	1
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country	3.3842176930742918
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr	1.7775735605319192
collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her	3.141816350502199
she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over	3.1050256526184428
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here	2.025327093158399
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming	1.9646087795854068
we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home	3.292256783850473
i should say one of her ladyship s carriages for she has several	4.738458115537002
lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour	1.5633797813106138
very true my dear that is exactly what i say	1.9528109907400326
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference	2.2377035788450264
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte s degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well	1.7975770057834606
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr	1.302905137537787
collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings	1.9575716232645712
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her	2.617649779412013
she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is	2.9791458501344246
make haste and come down this moment	1.3984337267153766
elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining room which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate	2.1585306565556657
and is this all cried elizabeth	1.2416098777967182
i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine	2.3679504205339392
the old lady is mrs	1
jenkinson who lives with them	1
only look at her	1
why does she not come in oh charlotte says she hardly ever does	1.5352237837425635
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in	2.7039248162301783
i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas	1.467860207866769
she looks sickly and cross	1
yes she will do for him very well	2.074789560098485
she will make him a very proper wife	3.0685665710567536
collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeth s high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way	3.282938817936957
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house	3.2179687451936685
chapter vi	1
collins s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	2.2959859264404434
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	3.461704011561007
i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings	3.1270732159030388
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire	2.609675382306877
about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	1.5561638693739233
collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them	1.8487010575787646
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel	2.0110052519167607
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more	3.47764593734057
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed	2.1355535440547735
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved	1.9549295437147156
such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st	3.0304815666323455
james s	1
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park	1.7038730318246038
every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr	3.290602021266145
collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh	2.070869735785512
elizabeth s courage did not fail her	1.269361490390293
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation	2.078300053360126
from the entrance hall of which mr	1.248938660179591
collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an anti chamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs	2.495082316280132
her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs	3.0259203248522035
collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her s it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary	2.992487230318898
in spite of having been at st	3.5085011823017753
james s sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look	2.6420931973878257
lady catherine was a tall large woman with strongly marked features which might once have been handsome	1.51359065314414
her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank	1.822924613914517
she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self importance and brought mr	1.7433795831482983
wickham immediately to elizabeth s mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented	2.7495502510907506
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr	1.8699436135041172
darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment at her being so thin and so small	2.715417595026509
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs	1.9564759055422738
jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes	1.8261991185793207
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr	3.8422102018894555
collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer	1.9647383162835403
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr	3.6863140814735855
he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear	2.1921063624814767
the party did not supply much conversation	1.2159453270118215
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time	3.6465263679018203
jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed	1.2580307955811905
maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire	2.6136358447524115
she enquired into charlotte s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her s and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry	2.042177963258488
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs	3.1476389495080714
collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs	2.579338549294071
collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl	1.3984642444520534
she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mother s maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly	2.719375322426168
collins i think	1
it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family	2.7152286724912504
do you play and sing miss bennet a little	1.5860744650921783
oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you	2.351030443726389
our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day	1.1991564448351781
why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned	1.4707201978434246
the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as your s	2.863349222488425
do you draw no not at all	1.0351046565308604
what none of you not one	1.141912109050286
that is very strange	1
but i suppose you had no opportunity	1.3274550483132772
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters	2.192593004102861
my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london	3.078247596281736
has your governess left you we never had any governess	1.2638633180294745
no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing	2.5550425788922833
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education	2.0634705765143444
then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must have been neglected	1.614519011729829
compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means	2.141168399640954
we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary	2.1345165219017375
aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one	2.8572736396609963
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it	2.1296548835639926
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way	2.360020842515216
four nieces of mrs	1
jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her	2.9727695564407877
collins did i tell you of lady metcalfe s calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure	1.5853128338667313
lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure	3.1293000468366823
all what all five out at once very odd and you only the second	2.0358890950323496
the younger ones out before the elder are married your younger sisters must be very young yes my youngest is not sixteen	2.3428968940356416
perhaps she is full young to be much in company	1.7086382554160608
but really ma am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early	2.7721400547025645
the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first	1.9722004003009221
and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind	3.1348143622037865
upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person	1.9865715392534036
pray what is your age with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it	1.801551847474762
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	1.979823951121498
you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age	2.913128807446503
i am not one and twenty	3.0673337955543127
when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed	3.1831277888343594
lady catherine sir william and mr	1.6571547813917928
and mrs	1
collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs	2.4995080819295006
jenkinson to make up her party	2.3217776756384474
their table was superlatively stupid	1
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs	2.7007464374191144
jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh s being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light	1.9588594547931306
sir william did not say much	1.6617955271114966
collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered	1.0330461886872817
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr	2.074440404350789
collins s side and as many bows on sir william s they departed	2.24373653134048
but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr	1.9752128250854144
collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands	4.140915763908295
sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with	2.5406372679924902
while sir william was with them mr	6.167340578709219
collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road	3.611151559641324
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards	1.756117783539993
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr	2.9686081888990152
collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement	2.0468307792560254
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr	2.219868376957066
collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day	1.7556576122261784
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out	2.368595052091307
very few days passed in which mr	1.7338288834931448
now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits	3.182575026063036
she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs	2.001439211548135
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr	1.911502058793899
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first	3.431010012246008
their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach	2.7125318340447655
this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors	2.734446630552019
her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity	2.1566123129259047
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	2.222400679658945
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important	3.952387174136129
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr	4.101635736154533
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr	3.533776791765021
collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence	2.2336758015033054
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects	1.8353512598050614
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr	3.4028745607575446
collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him	1.1246425106672433
charlotte had seen them from her husband s room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility	2.0724602166600423
darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me	1.801175066369847
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room	1.6452580591562727
colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman	2.1541762067436645
darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs	2.5202443936280043
collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure	1.7798687828553688
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word	1.2989399547277478
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs	2.6612374978486883
collins sat for some time without speaking to any body	1.748170074397545
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family	1.8866566513025789
she answered him in the usual way and after a moment s pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months	3.2004999241065577
have you never happened to see her there she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet	3.661503607709322
the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away	2.3760998092349426
chapter viii	1
colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings	3.4302322661571494
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr	3.0279708357040698
darcy they had only seen at church	3.3400757436852953
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine s drawing room	3.686471206849688
her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room	3.8186783906897803
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs	3.5203241026322956
collins s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much	1.98408490166223
he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr	2.8155219365530937
darcy	1
of music then pray speak aloud	1.574003707845178
it is of all subjects my delight	1.4504650134830805
i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music	3.1795959981665733
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste	1.8679779415137967
if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient	4.761679154655265
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully	2.009044019401542
how does georgiana get on darcy mr	1.0478217377808368
i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice	2.6746698701088376
she practises very constantly	1
so much the better	1
i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice	1.6681271230873527
i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs	2.708776571220466
collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in mrs	3.2113417356647216
she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house	3.0500062714019633
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument	2.243077984246238
he drew a chair near her	1.1085530479392591
lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s countenance	2.6085934203340173
elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me mr	2.506630228430399
darcy by coming in all this state to hear me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well	2.7621391456696345
i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own	3.3133408906356725
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say	2.425198715027989
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit	2.6564170474427606
indeed mr	1
darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear	1.9718156667801403
i am not afraid of you said he smilingly	4.4296067006103845
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam	1.864274627931375
i should like to know how he behaves among strangers	2.133589604560466
you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful	1.4589121363841593
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was	3.1767115045059926
darcy you cannot deny the fact	1.6013964387199306
i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party	3.32852485184376
true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room	1.8622457685433365
well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders	2.0659381887299517
perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	3.2568385215684317
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam	3.5699197515832344
shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him	2.586418983750778
it is because he will not give himself the trouble	3.589164106508946
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before	1.685672641605837
i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done	2.074744116950952
they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression	1.6529543758288692
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising	2.887502915285789
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution	2.854248689544676
darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right	2.4989314534908282
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting	1.8628779703283878
here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of	2.471108809570138
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master	3.065320895675247
she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s	1.593454674084256
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste	1.2119055380487236
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home	3.9545850200234485
chapter ix	1
collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor	2.161069823186706
as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr	2.9247106071894797
darcy only entered the room	1
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within	2.767678289635213
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence	1.6609457496526858
it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr	2.731255477744577
darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr	3.836624707703425
bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before	1.9686775403723367
perfectly so i thank you	1
she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that mr	3.5426647395102493
bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future	4.097365097843021
he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing	2.874543609129114
if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there	3.500482052048599
but perhaps mr	1
bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle	5.5966827769028065
i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers	3.1966985240554058
elizabeth made no answer	1
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him	2.818689822761263
he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house	2.454840292375234
lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr	2.2652150054497286
collins first came to hunsford	1
i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object	4.42429617241295
collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife	2.4710823818370042
my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr	3.6507353633575694
collins as the wisest thing she ever did	1.9948889847894844
she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her	2.3693589762179292
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends	4.30371170271628
and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a day s journey	2.836435143962626
yes i call it a very easy distance	2.132227106442515
i should never have said mrs	1.949351513227235
collins was settled near her family	1.0423190809121057
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire	5.453588260296658
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far	2.209081405291553
the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances	2.7430721645958904
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil	1.6557069715309296
but that is not the case here	4.726043495406484
and mrs	1
darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment	3.7758768556942908
you cannot have been always at longbourn	2.693800261771371
elizabeth looked surprised	1
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk	2.3975512630373483
the tête à tête surprised them	1.2479644342594474
darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away	1.8901143992687535
my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way	3.136770300928027
they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt	1.6080954572577557
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind	3.2342864995294818
darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand	3.013117766912664
it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself	2.5913177746707667
collins knew not what to make of him	2.0704039235180383
colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out	3.5122151058520945
she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success	3.128717666069039
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable	3.6477666770354316
it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind	1.7752176415346608
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs	6.900852546138052
in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam	1.535604009987107
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr	1.9845637905442997
darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all	2.904821921632256
chapter x	1
darcy	1
she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers	2.59596673730666
it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her	2.2014516386056475
he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr	2.6881044136545555
and mrs	1
collins s happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too	3.095666688342272
his words seemed to imply it	1.1122856570059132
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter	2.4454013427938075
it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage	4.336064194870343
she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr	2.649839320507144
darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her	1.4916969013118766
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way	3.483542994579917
i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage	4.116030860804301
are you going much farther no i should have turned in a moment	1.7281502993723932
do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she	1.2824472474791213
yes if darcy does not put it off again	1.5049791493871683
but i am at his disposal	2.4352887426690866
he arranges the business just as he pleases	2.140319318705766
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice	3.7738471434597307
darcy	1
but so we all do	1
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor	2.3009608103427786
i speak feelingly	1
a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence	1.7001912198911802
in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either	2.2192286451599683
now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature	1.9980248426425846
younger sons cannot marry where they like	1.7221070034392447
unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do	4.309722595486559
our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money	1.942433021150798
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped	1.989824205271417
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal	2.846300877423604
i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind	1.7315209419600583
but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her	4.683914545865891
no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me	2.185796643411215
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy	3.49639339607674
are you indeed and pray what sort of guardians do you make does your charge give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way	3.2702413858298436
she directly replied you need not be frightened	1.7870032205206012
i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world	3.1082996911712923
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs	3.885986810916726
hurst and miss bingley	1
i know them a little	1
their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy s	4.828912652379394
oh yes said elizabeth drily mr	1.0784806595279044
darcy is uncommonly kind to mr	1.1919413107388876
bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him	1.6247454582639722
care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care	4.023636794034248
from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him	1.6963626007961081
but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant	2.7232639877829965
it was all conjecture	1
what is it you mean it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing	3.32386224710154
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley	2.6814642412508567
what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	2.4396719876278503
did mr	1
darcy give you his reasons for this interference i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady	1.9481867709339014
and what arts did he use to separate them he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling	2.5251054284681076
he only told me what i have now told you	1.9171089569995816
elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation	2.0698579260731798
after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful	1.7044504914878051
your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings	2.074241533568431
why was he to be the judge you are rather disposed to call his interference officious i do not see what right mr	1.9946067741503364
but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him	1.9766019408866837
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case	3.983016945537032
that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly	2.6132759252418465
this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr	2.2696165951475544
darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage	2.34326160692055
there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard	2.5469922551486657
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected	2.684739364761286
there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr	1.584688265975003
darcy could have such boundless influence	1.8609822720367917
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr	2.192178325443301
bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them	4.389282797907877
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted	2.5969240162624216
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london	1.6986954591580528
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection	1.6473946289249994
all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating	3.057612374081939
neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr	1.9499509575029081
darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach	1.323276096895117
when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr	4.169996652666484
darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr	2.924503331059561
bingley for his sister	1
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr	1.7447102179478315
darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea	2.779375802103172
collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr	2.60153372219938
collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home	2.3998193644954737
chapter xi	1
when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr	2.6034348053222462
darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent	2.162826689903716
they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering	1.208941636577094
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded	2.389340815941835
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal	2.2697180010666216
darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings	2.1539042289767014
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do	4.214288689842316
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her	3.042569001890277
but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr	1.6504196531980455
darcy walk into the room	1
she answered him with cold civility	1.5528352403229875
he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room	2.021245421962755
elizabeth was surprised but said not a word	1.6941464040834897
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain have i struggled	2.7260037093175025
it will not do	1
my feelings will not be repressed	1.6654948764151845
elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression	1.3412433662356715
she stared coloured doubted and was silent	1.0877631292297016
this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed	3.683902385140887
he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride	2.69533659410561
his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit	1.5858040836738465
in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger	3.1062996936429
she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done	3.1982204614801035
as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer	5.146797731144712
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security	2.0246878784088933
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned	2.615111765808483
it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you	2.345662010842252
but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly	3.4934767628663885
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one	2.355153209978267
it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration	2.500444377428821
the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation	1.9567107496342355
darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise	1.7862291104955403
his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature	1.4897745834389098
he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it	2.117091741014005
the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful	7.649452151790968
at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected	2.910936999768057
but it is of small importance	2.339476647381946
i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations	1.7695092586091208
you know i have	1
had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister as she pronounced these words mr	2.879878258311212
darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued	1.6829406485900233
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you	4.042920442015087
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there	1.4235924687340469
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse	1.544415548525497
can you deny that you have done it she repeated	2.815698655969405
with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success	2.845731713364608
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself	2.2913385978762015
but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded	2.6708248173075244
long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided	1.9461303468770244
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr	2.1001952979500897
wickham	1
on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour	2.259093864955121
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed	2.0325235277266045
and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy	1.347208033888577
you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty	1.7588228170836493
you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him	1.8691957384899454
you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert	2.9696178598929293
you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule	2.4027714182766435
and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully	2.1754675983131655
my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design	1.420686788422084
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing	1.6054945069575641
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence	2.108699091407848
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related	3.1089075630499567
they were natural and just	1
darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner	2.0856832636586917
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it	3.7416043439314235
from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry	3.023054055797351
you have said quite enough madam	1.3606151178183294
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness	1.663024306136804
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house	2.2356675226644183
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great	2.0088268022366798
she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour	1.9917616242921243
her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it	1.5721046176798514
darcy that he should have been in love with her for so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	3.799420207506179
but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr	2.4639484375340324
wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	2.9484294297440967
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation and hurried her away to her room	1.930518510702641
chapter xii	1
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes	2.065628965637327
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise	2.796477702138544
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr	1.816289305164014
darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road	1.823532702153762
the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground	1.9121748585145861
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees	3.7190253775704387
she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr	2.6435529589147544
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name	1.6547266367889402
she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr	2.0718230262260064
darcy she moved again towards the gate	1.3615715137980589
he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you	2.8901823395390376
will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight	1.9386440153161915
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand	2.396991434069552
the envelope itself was likewise full	1.1659698024896887
pursuing her way along the lane she then began it	1.7546314627648452
it was dated from rosings at eight o clock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you	1.728265984576624
you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice	1.5041842691815148
two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge	2.765796580525756
bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr	3.264072261021992
wickham	1
wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison	2.1257123524824957
but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read	2.1873198508532887
if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your s i can only say that i am sorry	3.034437155797464
the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd	1.599527257141055
i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country	3.6014245992873994
i had often seen him in love before	2.7903430931238997
at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas s accidental information that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage	2.9118941055566356
he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided	3.9085569930027626
from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him	2.742102231651423
your sister i also watched	1
her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment	1.9316592444174285
if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error	4.413022172795018
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable	2.1011777100918696
if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable	2.138283309661545
but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched	2.3032663255172916
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears	1.93793291143327
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason	2.3398513402730456
my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me	3.225033260270224
but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me	2.0424154611762635
these causes must be stated though briefly	1.4511024498886715
the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father	2.1587012598962843
pardon me	1
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both	2.2596224857739595
i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection	2.8035480855853767
he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning	4.209626510789499
the part which i acted is now to be explained	1.3299895876303778
we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice	2.3528747054376096
i described and enforced them earnestly	1.1594256779244356
but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference	2.456162706668161
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard	1.7840568535188919
but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own	3.7810725126420475
to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point	4.915074993701631
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town	2.9847970696488813
i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it	3.391794502947974
that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger	3.121017503960632
perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me	1.0764015821320523
it is done however and it was done for the best	6.752575845421704
on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer	3.084337130060637
with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr	1.8953790905490655
wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family	2.2817751533000044
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity	2.5151921443407548
wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed	2.9492371624571203
my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education	2.3581285060677226
my father was not only fond of this young man s society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it	1.9421810183735675
as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner	4.7164198556712424
darcy could not have	1
here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell	2.3131640102917777
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr	1.788422178267854
wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character	2.0260636791989337
it adds even another motive	1
my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr	1.341161205268141
wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant	3.3118324964500716
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds	1.3515146006933043
his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr	2.7938261153365294
wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited	2.682659827568007
he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein	2.5953462221065435
i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal	1.514802367949483
i knew that mr	1
the business was therefore soon settled	1.2797719069963132
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds	3.5925258247688214
all connection between us seemed now dissolved	1.3658556974949703
i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town	2.1270767603884835
in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation	2.006553927183342
for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation	3.137165708104394
his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad	2.464941186022591
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it	1.7436152037332462
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself	2.6848729622058625
after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt	1.8301751706574758
how he lived i know not	1.1808870149542754
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice	2.3682126766266545
having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy	1.8559090194461738
my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself	1.948197019025075
about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr	2.429160763910911
wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs	3.564117218146985
she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself	3.1689041037713404
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me	1.985571006496397
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted	2.837753660817955
regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr	1.6480310103682956
wickham who left the place immediately and mrs	2.1052854783080037
wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement	2.0027277741587377
his revenge would have been complete indeed	1.8330795987128305
this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr	2.1643843087749137
wickham	1
i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at	2.9985870007866287
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination	1.8238901392625815
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night	2.915257532670119
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed	3.196586123314759
for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions	2.489886950359599
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning	2.223186565427848
i will only add god bless you	1.3154786155341585
fitzwilliam darcy	1
if elizabeth when mr	1
but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited	1.8006471761892793
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined	1.6277457314526962
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal	2.465590794869955
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield	2.7269886463521424
she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes	2.9364898845609506
his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice	3.0126638177542953
it was all pride and insolence	1.6420141400822743
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr	1.7037086279781293
wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition	2.0609626805665617
she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again	3.056713690394034
in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	2.360520336307875
so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great	3.777236232874422
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err	2.696617872740754
but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate	2.079639893184333
she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success	2.159062550772306
on both sides it was only assertion	3.6166698633036964
again she read on	1
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr	1.7596735390607727
darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole	2.273960032943633
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr	1.41664082983567
wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice	1.7679927539001365
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance	5.050492847197078
of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself	4.291310276709958
as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring	2.6971849030845685
his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue	3.2225491843251004
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr	1.4455299419925756
darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr	1.6124826356162858
darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance	1.4244877601201167
but no such recollection befriended her	1.0908000692963378
she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess	2.529685802574581
after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read	2.497928135479498
but alas the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question	2.4755769237602907
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr	3.335831069991534
darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration	2.463662194001547
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr	3.602367902360555
philips s	1
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory	3.6525474718171265
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before	1.662572555674911
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct	1.8931219583743293
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr	2.417496440389188
darcy that mr	1
darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week	2.8740857318911615
she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr	3.210367725500922
darcy s character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son	2.2253810815558737
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing	2.1140016892088664
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr	1.191414157024408
darcy she could not but allow that mr	3.0138954859834155
bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits	2.468347980373412
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling	2.853464881691888
that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr	2.498981145601619
bingley was incomprehensible	1
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself	1.1761688904968355
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd	1.836461088679834
how despicably have i acted she cried	1.1409360924701946
i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust	2.0988089100126257
how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind	3.0195082465414496
but vanity not love has been my folly	1.3223586743044784
pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned	3.032230510255999
till this moment i never knew myself	1.7515336480158488
darcy s explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again	1.6245489369677693
widely different was the effect of a second perusal	1.4869672448283098
how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had always been	2.510380835988582
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane	2.423441580581251
she felt that jane s feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility	2.489968411272511
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe	3.7451884511231435
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt	3.4132732474072367
it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before	2.4820962820064705
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	2.237901565127658
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr	1.9663473561421894
darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found	3.036985116614447
elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it	1.226241776078136
she could think only of her letter	2.8872092251462913
chapter xiv	1
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr	2.1192916500763843
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her	2.1516732571966086
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyship s indignation would have been	3.332336933516178
what would she have said how would she have behaved were questions with which she amused herself	2.5636769500045884
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party	1.3932084352925522
i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do	3.2342747948599873
but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are	2.9350938359518213
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year	1.7564857459452772
his attachment to rosings certainly increases	2.2159792350022127
collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	5.150388538695846
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer	3.8097853133180526
collins will be very glad of your company i am sure	2.3594352987315874
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it	2.1820365017964884
i must be in town next saturday	2.210875056723212
why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks	4.100106318552006
i expected you to stay two months	2.4597302543748527
i told mrs	1
there can be no occasion for your going so soon	2.4049143327934117
bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight	1.2896384747569276
he wrote last week to hurry my return	1.4092540451594506
oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can	1.2635952285165393
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father	2.0496371607102155
you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan	1.80297645044853
collins you must send a servant with them	3.0412125515534267
it is highly improper	1
you must contrive to send somebody	1.1443910293380282
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her	2.581939566927457
miss darcy the daughter of mr	1.9590932389744178
darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner	2.3394656982017397
collins	1
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone	2.5297846565467133
my uncle is to send a servant for us	2.7606423618644103
oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things	1.6930243709967612
where shall you change horses oh bromley of course	1.4394552543378893
if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to	2.44231008858179
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was	2.772129978800909
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections	2.300205790647772
she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different	2.5575524131827487
when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion	2.5666069059181544
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again	2.3107611812519697
in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	2.945009309658713
her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil	1.9810220043566515
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence what chance could there be of improvement catherine weak spirited irritable and completely under lydia s guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia self willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing	2.2336489948558107
they were ignorant idle and vain	2.150740865254277
while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever	2.925756125840724
anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern and mr	1.3283868216494303
his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend	1.6734112456552659
how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham s character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	2.614604943286256
when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both	2.4020177423902163
chapter xv	1
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr	1.839235127578557
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs	1.9716227339970305
collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it	2.69809422564566
the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you	2.4751774357472343
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode	1.3793705343570417
our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly	2.9550483293250034
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness	1.3499396123364635
collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably	2.6084344077583452
we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome	2.0058914702093165
our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast	2.78118785965981
you see how continually we are engaged there	1.7296684539921026
in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings	1.9690158489697658
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences	2.4767935701255457
you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin	1.4159885225025006
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so	3.3835163080196504
lady catherine s great attentions to mrs	2.0598248182164633
collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent	3.2173826422645093
only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage	2.4705121159722285
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking	2.8873281461870177
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us	1.535395574924266
we seem to have been designed for each other	2.0461243376680183
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts	2.907716909183462
she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung	3.0753370498523176
poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion	2.888985536659523
her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms	2.0062291929310105
at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready	1.6027683699495772
after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr	2.880372553616511
collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr	2.586583949849404
and mrs	1
gardiner though unknown	1
but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here	2.3228259241286393
elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off	2.5948988816765364
good gracious cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh	2.6503954362904243
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr	1.8498600382731043
gardiner s house where they were to remain a few days	1.7503801073223897
but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation	2.6045333138705504
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr	2.2285901498358354
darcy s proposals	1
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther	2.9201104037495798
chapter xvi	1
it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr	3.834133988072875
bennet s carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachman s punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs	2.3226241814198003
these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a sallad and cucumber	1.9362940020679626
after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there	1.6188553598096944
then shewing her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet	1.2739456467101362
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better	2.656778275975411
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable	1.85344586835626
besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight	3.320466124494622
are they indeed cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction	1.7252537489984974
they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all	2.5006520300890482
mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once	2.135251234624954
what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like	4.049326868661071
jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay	2.041863801882528
lydia laughed and said aye that is just like your formality and discretion	1.4143400928760204
you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say	3.7269311319376244
but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone	1.6114114733524798
i never saw such a long chin in my life	2.0774048486791514
well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king	3.490171303499885
there s for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay	1.9750362710195641
she is a great fool for going away if she liked him	1.8780656907520104
but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane	3.225516580707182
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her	2.444545174728172
who could about such a nasty little freckled thing elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kitty s and lydia s purchases were seated in it	2.1019613715949546
how nicely we are crammed in cried lydia	1.0163410733246712
i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home	1.8983288620175964
and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away	2.3094650254523073
have you seen any pleasant men have you had any flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back	2.6324682601281455
jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare	1.8171167017795509
she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you can t think	2.752455129653781
she says lizzy had better have taken mr	1.6553307346267847
collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it	2.6190475018446167
dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster s	3.578049918954133
forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs	5.620251194454677
forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but col	2.0681279527170906
forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least	4.130054659738235
lord how i laughed and so did mrs	1.1436690348389702
forster	1
and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter	2.086503455686147
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kitty s hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn	1.876034530991481
elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name	2.995576844610418
their reception at home was most kind	1.1777169035521209
bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr	4.8014206024935
bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy	2.134631679261494
their party in the dining room was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs	1.945922336043109
bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other person s was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	2.5037354624724397
oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too	2.9954346605491176
and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach	3.025263360104269
i was ready to die of laughter	1.3490666249661767
and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures	2.917327642105665
but i confess they would have no charms for me	1.8519364452478428
i should infinitely prefer a book	1.0351388948674163
but of this answer lydia heard not a word	2.7573828641550824
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all	2.632750507244788
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme	2.5407575090248926
it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers	3.442695113345949
there was another reason too for her opposition	1.2710433293978203
she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	1.690613791092102
the comfort to her of the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression	1.4822471579507965
in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account	2.6534615874764587
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents	3.3146430251995374
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	2.31083583044689
chapter xvii	1
elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr	2.886231796563405
darcy and herself	1
miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings	1.8254577401208483
she was sorry that mr	1
darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him	2.1481348124094115
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment	1.6731298265555443
indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me	3.166259914502539
you do not blame me however for refusing him blame you oh no	2.483644998697463
but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham	2.139211948712017
no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did	3.8171934796806513
but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day	3.2273297594180055
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham	4.166881545401663
what a stroke was this for poor jane who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual	1.7949591939269725
nor was darcy s vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery	1.427004757147556
this will not do said elizabeth	2.777934657550421
you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing	4.2373100622989215
take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one	3.7821988177463806
there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much	2.5285055537885066
for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr	2.846623279062712
darcy s but you shall do as you chuse	3.615541033136311
it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane	2.9708096450105677
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she	3.920310452738134
wickham so very bad it is almost past belief	2.1133952212737803
and poor mr	1
darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered	1.946640877212554
i am sure you must feel it so	3.040982692327222
i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent	2.2969153327470675
your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather	1.8290171378609459
poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner	2.3365336077357144
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men	2.707937388044404
one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it	2.447215035911346
i never thought mr	1
darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do	3.9623819792042534
it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind	1.7387836786269497
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty	1.9997047589992258
lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now	3.2113219303512355
indeed i could not	1
i was uncomfortable enough	1
i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy	2.281179050228199
and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr	3.1009200518971096
darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved	1.3447946572349867
certainly	1
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging	1.755512125628336
there is one point on which i want your advice	2.330424185982455
i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character	2.5674529203403305
miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully	1.5267928873959056
what is your own opinion that it ought not to be attempted	3.5566708513697933
darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public	2.5611318741035096
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr	3.417575858242928
darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light	2.0794407382928966
i am not equal to it	4.84846665850745
wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is	3.121041179558543
at present i will say nothing about it	2.312772490992423
you are quite right	1
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever	1.4658637393226353
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character	1.9464446777204365
the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation	1.529775505420219
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either	2.1700391469055718
but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure	1.9967437055528923
she dared not relate the other half of mr	2.0435887097803267
darcy s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend	2.975966750948356
and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself	3.446846295685528
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits	2.9030822350120657
jane was not happy	1
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley	1.3105333335657379
well lizzy said mrs	1
bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane s for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody	3.564450978484218
i told my sister philips so the other day	2.2825627687301964
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london	2.7759786377206557
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know	2.83707552847415
i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more	3.258602142776931
oh well it is just as he chooses	3.9510475305253676
nobody wants him to come	1
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it	3.9007148203141147
well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done	3.623659093836189
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer	1.628676989477769
well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it will last	1.8603499530746908
and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say	1.5103294309950892
if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough	3.1466621963932715
no nothing at all	1
a great deal of good management depend upon it	2.417881718961059
yes yes	1
they will take care not to outrun their income	1.6702111777673783
they will never be distressed for money	1.7673785075922575
well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead	2.077946266283648
they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens	1.4390010988356243
it was a subject which they could not mention before me	3.2595065662215905
it would have been strange if they had	1.8212301543662883
but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves	1.8207970429334772
well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better	1.7295924852644533
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	2.910058035254137
chapter xviii	1
the first week of their return was soon gone	1.7348284081638188
the second began	1
it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace	3.9174741182265045
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments	1.5552620320904391
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family	1.7585439331628032
good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe	1.7396882089360137
how can you be smiling so lizzy their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago	2.5361496337237095
i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millar s regiment went away	2.0205352443379327
i thought i should have broke my heart	3.704612567441954
i am sure i shall break mine said lydia	1.7627781751750267
if one could but go to brighton observed mrs	1.648536726304933
bennet	1
oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable	1.6390207527152059
a little sea bathing would set me up for ever	1.441854530481303
and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty	2.271139970850588
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house	1.4085576090058665
she felt anew the justice of mr	1.6810319804652332
darcy s objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend	2.563015319636901
but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs	2.907851298917378
forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton	2.9905557045488473
this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married	2.9974430005579915
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two	3.6355763863939194
the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs	3.0925020596759403
forster the delight of mrs	1
bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described	2.6120492154152752
i cannot see why mrs	1
forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend	3.8481986222209095
i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older	5.11803951010766
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs	3.065026709966644
he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances	3.221013417291051
if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair	2.450050733824165
bennet	1
what has she frightened away some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down	1.9873660891600986
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret	1.4842360385510325
come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly	1.5938825363722857
indeed you are mistaken	1
i have no such injuries to resent	1.5260409085905782
it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining	1.6796949019554799
our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character	1.672059054684887
if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment	2.4658677340742003
her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous	2.295936900565002
a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite	1.716661535646974
in this danger kitty is also comprehended	1.4240676393187575
she will follow wherever lydia leads	1.2303290992053277
vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace mr	2.208848811120636
bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love	4.8832778728788
let her go then	1
colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body	2.399635082677306
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here	3.0046504712200184
let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance	1.1976286398087808
at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life	3.099481985728267
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry	2.167783413057187
it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them	1.812308140339594
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition	2.0121002589020396
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility	2.3295800311249955
in lydia s imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness	2.40579905698471
she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers	1.398370807419087
she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once	1.6426521754492913
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same	2.651968126557144
lydia s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband s never intending to go there himself	1.9592619960655708
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia s leaving home	2.8331919246023114
elizabeth was now to see mr	3.2465948428218243
wickham for the last time	1
having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so	2.210699308705704
she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary	1.2713957686997557
in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her	2.517626572604094
on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and mr	3.2471970000589816
darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	2.2212560597335105
her answer was warmly in his favour	1.1624092049882624
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say that he was at rosings nearly three weeks	2.3418813699831613
and you saw him frequently yes almost every day	1.29584550162326
his manners are very different from his cousin s	3.108271405614133
yes very different	1
but i think mr	1
oh no said elizabeth	1
in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was	4.885290792129948
while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning	1.581660962237554
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood	2.7704799105817606
wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards mr	2.6690132526512653
darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right	2.4754855971740364
his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by	2.678619988394356
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe	1.9823526309486796
his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart	5.335178294468561
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head	3.5054266341264153
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him	2.2556261165450784
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs	2.424450992554094
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic	2.0792284879326193
kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy	1.3439174864996515
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard	2.474993616673873
chapter xix	1
had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort	2.621680720178906
her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her	2.279371503065184
respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown	1.5331043058967848
but mr	1
bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice	2.0301033907414983
he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments	2.5415388192366666
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement	2.1971577416586676
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given	2.347987024497277
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband	4.0988572869616755
she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible	1.8679664162686003
but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	2.095824761569958
their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp	1.9178740498961846
upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself	2.687244102894234
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment	2.0300654719833453
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	3.048061218730845
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for	2.9233393298719696
were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain	1.4701467279469635
but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister s absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized	2.6782493763793744
a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation	2.0476682768663323
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short	2.4732362941792365
those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs	3.3634217310306256
forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public	4.103132730109317
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn	1.7557782219425713
everything wore a happier aspect	1
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs	2.8915727145037087
gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent	1.022275564936923
gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire	2.5508902221386727
in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs	2.817705953290509
gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction	1.111853145399178
elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough	2.682374168623918
but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again	3.176913228899076
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected	2.1222726211265366
but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me	1.461235578554606
the period of expectation was now doubled	2.323786960567079
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt s arrival	2.2443354427179343
but they did pass away and mr	1.5631158248511017
and mrs	1
the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them	1.8586714333011938
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement	1.6079596062739396
one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad	1.5019462352654769
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenelworth birmingham c	2.8369036433295793
are sufficiently known	1
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern	2.7385451642327845
to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs	1.8657385927722725
gardiner s former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated	2.4632686617837254
in talking over their route the evening before mrs	2.4805600980254465
gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again	2.3514891044195805
gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation	1.5033105715232733
my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much said her aunt	3.1632180843985793
elizabeth was distressed	1
she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it	2.595990687874194
she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains	1.6549062168594209
gardiner abused her stupidity	1
if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful	2.9610595778637787
they have some of the finest woods in the country	1.9454881424644122
elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce	3.372015421484756
the possibility of meeting mr	1
darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred	1.109763415949355
it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk	2.8960311187030734
but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered	2.3508219490993048
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer	2.3816770986175992
a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme	3.0597059255036863
to pemberley therefore they were to go	1.6923860241159385

chapter i	1
elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter	2.353026692069898
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground	1.6400713427815719
they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent	1.6737623308163132
elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view	2.815335075247374
they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound	1.7738102061198793
it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance	1.962620624363305
its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned	1.0797154982934434
elizabeth was delighted	1
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste	2.0837298944735894
they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned	2.552952531987002
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken	87.18876466437898
on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was	2.5098820867960665
the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her	1.4906119557632445
they followed her into the dining parlour	1.4340370096493444
it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up	1.933494333661648
elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect	2.0074184376418867
the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object	2.2551769388219074
the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings	2.267090900463675
but no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them	2.8953992928823733
this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret	1.4259588536698702
at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs	2.966440343716936
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day her aunt now called her to look at a picture	1.9101904686678004
she approached and saw the likeness of mr	1.2478572994929507
wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantle piece	1.0924386872253276
her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it	1.1978292881951156
he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild	2.414520451031705
gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it	3.615307269231699
and that said mrs	1
reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him	2.493188985687246
it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago	1.9649411361302058
i have heard much of your master s fine person said mrs	6.9927301736579475
gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face	2.6403397427123414
but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not	2.5653371949710606
reynolds s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master	1.772603097919675
does that young lady know mr	1.5105989420419887
and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ma am yes very handsome	1.9106395868394315
i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this	3.152548991081344
this room was my late master s favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then	1.7232533429796604
he was very fond of them	2.9649828904883733
this accounted to elizabeth for mr	1.8780147897839405
wickham s being among them	1
reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old	3.1543787108903607
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mr	3.90426572219741
gardiner	1
oh yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long	1.9008109694496083
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here to morrow with him	2.9189120248024634
reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister	2.909352302360094
except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate	1.1625581108253813
if your master would marry you might see more of him	2.3724392346701713
yes sir but i do not know when that will be	1.6404543121253126
i do not know who is good enough for him	2.4795785260717547
and mrs	1
gardiner smiled	1
i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him replied the other	2.8721490982199605
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old	2.9551322601702097
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas	1.9786355954754982
that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion	3.8681243491847326
her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said	2.1134678477073026
you are lucky in having such a master	1.5288135542326906
if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better	5.6007052361153296
but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world	2.6365537285124874
elizabeth almost stared at her	1
can this be mr	1
darcy thought she	1
his father was an excellent man said mrs	4.060759717210662
gardiner	1
yes ma am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor	2.2042973368196765
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more	1.4948234425413436
reynolds could interest her on no other point	1.5366280813506703
she related the subject of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain	2.261453368768072
gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase	2.7800357731730116
he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived	2.4728692140510575
not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves	2.8033484374501394
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name	2.9605581865445987
some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it	2.165492573415351
to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men	2.0979053363831053
in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth	1.684638946958091
this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend	1.8800283447488886
that is not very likely our authority was too good	3.0162451136317157
on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley	1.9736493062981397
he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows	2.5159066354996007
reynolds anticipated miss darcy s delight when she should enter the room	2.5066032322582203
and this is always the way with him she added	3.0276591050433583
whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment	1.9478103490052132
there is nothing he would not do for her	6.488232358891365
in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger	2.2700333264575376
at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr	1.2035098367846284
darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her	3.3281982272152377
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery	1.7513033852323694
reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s life time	3.4088815966779182
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth s mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance	2.8809687384786997
reynolds was of no trifling nature	1.1060347977172866
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow how much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression	2.9424507393298174
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door	2.154559063559331
they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight	3.4139001782477107
their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush	1.4476954818643613
he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility	1.704752174519432
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome	2.010370548768248
darcy the gardener s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it	1.623025121530833
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family	2.0294877920519476
nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts	2.257677201897946
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave	1.6168992820261332
the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence	3.1730803356362878
she was overpowered by shame and vexation	1.0953277219052542
her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world how strange must it appear to him in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come or why did he thus come a day before he was expected had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage	2.7465680116531157
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting	2.610489996352592
and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean that he should even speak to her was amazing but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting	2.3791583894264514
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing s park when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think nor how to account for it	2.8063716878243574
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene	2.5892868801329487
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr	2.2057931402018065
darcy then was	1
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him	6.12650179800491
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease	3.5936253906817752
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure	3.655436294087647
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself	2.535857969468368
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream	1.8195394561083522
gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk	2.2870475279222036
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round	1.911260792521776
it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts	1.81075812278631
they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it	1.70095970982873
elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs	1.6813136064498677
gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible	2.687641165754539
gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little	2.2354653191634406
whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr	2.7949540850876984
darcy approaching them and at no great distance	1.3054084067791722
elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them	2.2764137694197797
for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path	3.4327279397221657
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them	1.995251122524803
with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed	2.9177445926142096
gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	3.302119313635949
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself	2.844520187977272
what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion	2.434476009538671
the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions	2.6766142905145256
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr	2.2286199726356584
gardiner	1
elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph	3.232534054120961
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush	3.166881500643425
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners	2.162861488995179
darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport	2.245240099820731
elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself	2.1278204399966816
her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered from what can it proceed it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened	3.1037586538116853
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this	1.7553759550736028
it is impossible that he should still love me	2.8699446380712215
gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s	1.4470116243841726
darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together	1.8041456394948174
after a short silence the lady first spoke	2.9886529605549255
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country	4.083761144126145
he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling	2.8189415316243527
they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr	1.7061776261182098
bingley and his sisters	1
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr	2.3800323638712024
bingley s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged	3.993936664123989
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it	2.922724371509685
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her	2.5307511504496256
they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought	1.5222799697157077
his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind	4.190205405806944
they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr	3.576383001427974
and mrs	1
gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind	1.7414597073860083
he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn	2.1071802898076775
at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward	3.325891015411782
she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject	2.0880831990731896
at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance	1.9955855060162009
yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over	2.2980111464315893
on mr	1
gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness	3.5905468375186387
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected	3.2306409804132428
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle	1.7083014116419148
there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming	3.6635057111367075
i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it	2.6035467095479974
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us	1.6698589920283065
it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention	2.2497145723072833
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling	2.1764171285250247
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning	3.8151041443235987
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle	1.6341725081100609
from what we have seen of him continued mrs	3.339029262961725
gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham	3.638534122956598
he has not an ill natured look	2.8144162613978896
on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks	2.7889100412614596
and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart	3.5171936032589706
but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes	2.0532118337709058
but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue	3.3636642807413866
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire	4.255744052035842
in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on	2.575676285411403
gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else	3.061746607649279
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr	2.844582689444382
darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister	2.003366725375635
chapter ii	1
elizabeth had settled it that mr	1.5779178469071091
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came	2.928228856234377
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street	2.5906860925035233
her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business	2.677825818782629
nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece	2.4437436448688166
while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing	1.566385762390297
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	2.0802657114906413
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse	1.9043222999419964
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place	3.593003388156472
with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself	2.039672398426558
since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy	3.5147528775671826
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable	1.8208304582242556
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful	1.6070869643663679
she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle	3.246598745118375
elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr	2.0870977762025604
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room	3.237001429402507
all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again	2.3213581239660797
he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done	2.8209273333715768
and mrs	1
gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself	1.694698467052968
the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention	2.490816469817424
darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love	1.8483702875832233
of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough	1.842300828291642
elizabeth on her side had much to do	2.48982979275304
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	2.782067773636501
bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased	1.9007927982682473
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner	3.425509118974205
sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance	2.443214298430904
but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane	3.4448283007563005
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard	2.7335050289792364
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister	1.6921188561410467
on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared	1.748440329364871
we have not met since the <num>th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield	1.5972683409022803
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn	2.882443864828986
darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day	2.6018598933361874
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible	2.5891263415159345
never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings	2.135613799922457
their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr	2.035865879887791
and mrs	1
gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country	3.710080422937219
miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed	1.6006061099628561
gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head	2.234854027892742
presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on	2.1305857553146708
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends	3.401696933259343
elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little	2.6880168874435193
eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress	2.6616055140507173
but she had no reason to fear mr	3.782114053442
and mrs	1
gardiner s curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication	2.274399408628237
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr	2.926716165908839
darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her	3.5660403538905303
they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry	1.4499392571133065
of mr	1
darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find	3.4317950583980266
they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for mr	3.462128225819811
darcy	1
there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected	2.5308293989415733
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight	1.64902134533088
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit	1.7338827478070031
it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	1.9608101065636165
darcy afterwards discharged	1
as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out	3.0714516332665083
no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called	2.802404166738505
it was gratitude	1
he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister	2.8448213484044764
such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined	2.55897544194012
she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	2.243993030883
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning	3.2289823236730357
they were therefore to go	1
elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply	3.564612196535363
gardiner left them soon after breakfast	1.1818514576481602
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon	3.3485269155132724
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed	2.614435824187693
on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer	1.7096579046496947
its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn	1.8363425961589277
in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs	3.558372820818972
hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london	3.0044325251811235
georgiana s reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved	1.5385225751657532
gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her	2.030761141279635
hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments	2.2710844973353637
it was first broken by mrs	1.0664336352359955
annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mrs	2.1029538373301278
gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on	1.2334031303551283
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard	2.418828008625077
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention	3.2504519677651285
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much	2.685641474653396
her own thoughts were employing her	1.7420995997458912
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room	2.0498411579409073
she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine	2.5288526446502733
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley s voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family	1.9274470184540549
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs	1.7295438397212686
annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post	3.7634096864953452
there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table	2.0043747046892277
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr	1.9569536743624556
darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came	3.972902918897156
gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning	3.1815957864993547
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room	3.0258935952945736
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley s in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr	2.04658876548834
darcy were by no means over	2.67769852455367
miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton they must be a great loss to your family	2.6830235754072955
while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes	1.76191334568132
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps	2.475038236318662
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement	2.06852569908031
to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingley s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own	2.174354281273262
he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend	2.5399595161160673
elizabeth s collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more	1.4833121580368276
her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully	2.409306820117296
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr	1.8822588900726
darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person behaviour and dress	3.021379728826823
her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable	2.6540480305209306
when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister	3.068460272128907
how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr	1.3965090972358818
darcy she cried i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter	2.6642569916697734
she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again	1.9600960574725623
however little mr	1
for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her	2.5908398550174194
her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome	1.575326494476815
her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines	1.254014323827903
her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them	2.837926692893977
they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable	3.3884682829429376
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected	2.2644528041532324
he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit	2.309207533976385
but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time	2.141003223962385
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance	2.694566046486102
he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself	3.350559554673834
they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs	4.602366638088761
gardiner thought of him and mrs	3.2767760122954037
gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s beginning the subject	1.838558058423977
chapter iv	1
elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill	2.8599824235893654
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves	2.0021680654461886
the one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago	1.6993246650635923
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence	1.8210995547143622
what i have to say relates to poor lydia	2.4660965841866127
an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise	3.4623127623129246
to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected	2.22182135950914
i am very very sorry	1
so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood	2.6894172186553975
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart	1.6922464246871032
his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing	2.1267650095079267
our poor mother is sadly grieved	1.334203752785299
my father bears it better	1
how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves	1.9473605225053612
the express was sent off directly	1.2300765268155567
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon	1.2344970024098256
lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention	1.4707921692555141
i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother	2.5302183251306913
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written	4.725500594012115
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first	2.4508179980837363
dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed	3.5357932583762404
imprudent as a marriage between mr	1.7294695115479202
wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland	2.2828581841521305
colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express	2.0735489526014583
though lydia s short letter to mrs	1.2270795990038317
never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f	1.727281027174958
who instantly taking the alarm set off from b	2.1173157973390193
intending to trace their route	1
he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom	2.0139898500407414
all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road	2.401438383331698
i know not what to think	1.4714117321419429
after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f	1.0566654465591696
came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through	1.8639389058224194
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart	2.595878044831714
but no one can throw any blame on them	1.9318561589911865
our distress my dear lizzy is very great	1.7861974300502623
my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him	3.399609078933302
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia s connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing impossible	2.9587913097963345
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w	2.172627843601019
was not a man to be trusted	1.7654328805099544
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room	1.9865181328058887
could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected	3.4497219711754656
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder	3.338016595209474
i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient	2.3968591225844342
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former	3.244497067635869
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her	2.26151596827451
what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening	3.5670135518500015
in such an exigence my uncle s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness	2.899525302428703
oh where where is my uncle cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr	1.9549759750966642
darcy appeared	1
i must find mr	1
gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose	2.0021209335756573
good god what is the matter cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr	1.7900632133036603
and mrs	1
gardiner	1
you are not well enough you cannot go yourself	3.250509285050955
elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them	1.4125649409610417
calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly	2.072927084365516
is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill	1.7498927931535784
no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself	1.3135857802169717
i am quite well	1
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	1.9969598357973908
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word	2.2782400740310034
darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence	1.5257704041498237
at length she spoke again	1
i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news	2.342580633161219
it cannot be concealed from any one	1.8905173697506092
my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr	2.9265328636074277
wickham	1
they are gone off together from brighton	2.4617001897876825
you know him too well to doubt the rest	2.0506769103797544
she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever	1.624497834433607
darcy was fixed in astonishment	1
when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was	2.822216379213288
had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened	2.71560414192573
but it is all all too late now	2.3612904286094314
i am grieved indeed cried darcy grieved shocked	2.0923277058140033
but is it certain absolutely certain oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland	1.4092813430549906
and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour	3.0994387387762035
but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done	2.0879851369369025
it is every way horrible darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence	1.439217954550932
when my eyes were opened to his real character	1.2450093928115726
oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much	2.9415380880916984
wretched wretched mistake darcy made no answer	1.0314905748250418
he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy	2.2720379132633597
elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it	1.4542282239285733
her power was sinking every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace	2.1601027741398404
it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain	2.4531825065728405
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress	2.398286931959458
but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks	2.8182607552130228
this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day	2.4957368084900997
oh yes	1
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy	1.5903040243548963
say that urgent business calls us home immediately	1.0914127832329739
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible	2.9253967446796603
i know it cannot be long	3.8216135293308597
he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away	1.6824647379069444
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination	2.5207137603514003
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty	1.5901648130300963
be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business	2.7442370554873774
never since reading jane s second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her	2.4516355793609743
no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation	3.1599831477120137
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement	2.8505114542459347
but now it was all too natural	2.8269876034485546
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey	2.4393698304063265
sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion	1.3560621013146554
her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object	1.2469100623826055
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl	1.8372899672462952
she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe	2.2712400082259423
and mrs	1
though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr	2.838985142070056
and mrs	1
gardiner could not but be deeply affected	2.3576446174696772
elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled	1.4504433712151334
they were to be off as soon as possible	4.777822465292897
but what is to be done about pemberley cried mrs	2.912248705999322
gardiner	1
john told us mr	1
darcy was here when you sent for us was it so yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement	2.6462602975577907
that is all settled	1
that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare	3.4183818647851045
and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour	2.523575152760655
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure	2.9522355319923728
an hour however saw the whole completed and mr	1.7014196391453622
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn	2.9117168224319774
chapter v	1
i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter	2.589318657226713
it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best	2.3999833029637383
could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk	2.2096217485822685
do you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment	1.5691640334898094
upon my word said mrs	1
gardiner i begin to be of your uncle s opinion	4.1649683188796445
it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it	1.9830225339032996
i cannot think so very ill of wickham	1.925108593340065
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable	1.8859434476621426
why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case in the first place replied mr	3.2730150402021043
gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland	1.8189591805529455
oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road	2.5579329966707074
well then supposing them to be in london	1.7106120786543837
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland	2.66464033297761
but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely	1.736069895503104
wickham will never marry a woman without some money	2.467760868529666
he cannot afford it	1
and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce	2.078107356759311
but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good	3.1313773714376634
but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt	2.6207178748058815
but really i know not what to say	3.0040547741233867
perhaps i am not doing her justice	1.9465846430413576
but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity	2.9064944252976517
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way	2.242481936941702
since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head	1.8964041867572627
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough	2.906130066539059
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman	2.1718828455031303
but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt	3.905205933351325
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word	2.4463342221891184
that he has neither integrity nor honour	1.8311575623311018
that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating	2.149873947792935
and do you really know all this cried mrs	2.5934809512026766
gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	1.9972311568055605
i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr	2.6233146552795263
darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him	2.290143537997467
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless	2.44961906745263
from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl	2.223692564635827
yet he knew to the contrary himself	1.4020097124504118
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her	4.035719255617229
till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr	2.508178905735863
darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself	2.8863204122528643
as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs	3.0237147138683684
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head	2.8339752633862285
that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts	1.9225447356440157
not the slightest	1
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away	2.9577780324862135
when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were	2.1410781297985366
every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites	2.5665793239637824
it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey	2.456197078091233
from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent	2.841086961115993
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness	1.7406204412264579
they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day	1.7749184181482294
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	2.017692180339469
elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mother s apartment immediately met her	1.911634403661416
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives	2.625213173399379
not yet replied jane	1
but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well	1.6372766766895124
is my father in town yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word	2.6572709317036125
and have you heard from him often we have heard only once	3.139118620168671
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do	2.3067753288602955
and my mother how is she how are you all my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken	2.174611549950289
she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all	1.9394092135226677
she does not yet leave her dressing room	2.4520026070906984
mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well	1.0597863968123489
but you how are you cried elizabeth	1.5605366112622907
you look pale	1
how much you must have gone through her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr	2.796743524180718
and mrs	1
gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party	2.4963131202431263
jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears	1.7679558746451547
when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give	4.26050332270685
the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage	2.6040527353986476
bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing	2.214811383399662
if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her	2.6295364400310115
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after	4.369477878290877
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am	2.4196896916093404
poor dear child and now here s mr	2.0314646418970463
bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do	3.0173423337454603
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr	1.2935305602716611
gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr	4.189247605211842
bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia	1.1706640312452015
do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain	2.2133306202691294
it is not quite a week since they left brighton	2.9494336366648146
as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done	2.9169402532585056
oh my dear brother replied mrs	5.8154875142277715
bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for	3.910450839519098
and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry	2.741437332628552
and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married	2.4545845635700383
and above all things keep mr	1.676540882492862
bennet from fighting	1
tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day	2.35359660931886
and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses	3.009424514139157
oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all	1.9605631487581587
but mr	1
gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters	2.7849943280699523
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject	2.4910764820018447
in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before	2.6153711124440187
the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty	3.181934400709522
as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of	1.8662186485001382
then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex	1.8370523156265628
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply	2.0755544281479055
mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them	1.4879996364810932
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy	2.8778259212223842
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard	2.6111182875520877
give me farther particulars	1
what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever	2.942382476239203
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm	2.3340083204569906
i am so grieved for him	1.5999828795603865
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost	1.5649905099340087
he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey	3.5619469867125053
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it	2.522291395974224
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before	3.234793789101426
and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right	2.9219594111778524
my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be	1.86230766790375
kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step	3.0801563236211433
she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks	2.7877458492778544
but not before they went to brighton no i believe not	1.5617523278829109
and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself does he know his real character i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did	3.11475253219391
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant	2.662540884452763
and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false	2.653713198334433
oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened perhaps it would have been better replied her sister	2.3254790132654626
but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable	2.195057274102774
we acted with the best intentions	1.0678191344950547
jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth	1.2932676465826962
these were the contents my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am missed	2.275998637514327
i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel	3.8817425318187038
i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off	2.0731918686279065
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham	3.3762453754380175
what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for laughing	2.8223162995177584
pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night	1.5589029668554812
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure	3.7640794119766685
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up	2.050096776466084
good bye	1
give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey	2.9291825671072758
your affectionate friend lydia bennet	1
oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it	1.951486592381862
what a letter is this to be written at such a moment	2.4455116267505637
but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey	5.379478863656683
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy	3.340755057483223
my poor father how he must have felt it i never saw any one so shocked	2.30689391436586
i hope there was	1
but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult	2.109867882735317
your attendance upon her has been too much for you	2.549084265488511
you do not look well	1
oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone	3.44690882246176
mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them	3.4607972605135595
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me	2.0688237321852814
she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours	2.181903298016948
assistance is impossible condolence insufferable	1
let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied	1.2040640151992905
he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them	2.344599826140378
his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham	2.452687639167246
it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham	2.907909256675085
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this	3.6931095045400752
chapter vi	1
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion	2.385027187350647
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain	3.3861045135102694
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	2.5142984602486784
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr	2.751200093931632
bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husband s not being killed in a duel	3.038291573696296
gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces	2.2603362689651334
she shared in their attendance on mrs	1.33721273208655
bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom	3.8240566221391523
their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham s extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them	2.1844304483933232
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesman s family	1.9596320566841001
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness	2.9903022399997385
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them	2.7574949188175073
gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street	3.4931305948783375
that mr	1
bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr	2.750521156379701
gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it	2.9984188502568734
he added that mr	1
there was also a postscript to this effect	1.383623478995151
i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself	3.5412895383422827
if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence	1.940481066792142
at present we have nothing to guide us	1.7964955187404195
colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head	3.6836026077190964
but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person	2.23134558089481
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved	2.2761452322854994
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected	3.8437864134141084
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience	3.070992730732634
through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance	2.159665700116825
but before they heard again from mr	2.6007638999809815
gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr	2.576396248312593
it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire	2.052818883689424
be assured my dear sir that mrs	1.4811821499066398
collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove	2.7885068197020253
no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent s mind	1.9681097549986064
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this	5.123076520285348
bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age	2.5265599791048587
collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair	3.0835011255576794
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family	2.6209611926226164
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace	1.6672918264538639
let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence	3.6773245768570275
i am dear sir c	1
gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	4.203542524404103
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living	3.5485265232636514
his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them	4.41980908968887
and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount	3.2274690962933934
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton	2.2110606532202937
he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable	2.8689324953689397
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror	2.268554133502181
gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday	4.004100895560214
rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brother in law s intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit	3.1670269710794074
when mrs	1
bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before	3.5213307744214983
what is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried	1.4743681416766157
sure he will not leave london before he has found them	3.584435826650568
who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away as mrs	1.4545902253503287
gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr	3.9411627010042336
bennet came from it	1
the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn	2.1521581325357975
gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world	2.272891598688303
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of half expectation which mrs	3.0219647942611374
gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	3.2117245447322773
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley	2.171457243090007
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydia s infamy somewhat better	2.884668366472087
it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two	2.3519808166950322
when mr	1
bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure	2.1484045540073704
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it	3.5188389802902926
it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that	2.8326450646680197
who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it	2.8306772834391927
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth	2.258203312459273
you may well warn me against such an evil	1.2432614664149593
human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame	2.322772271801982
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression	1.8653465004605159
it will pass away soon enough	1.2017127434448096
do you suppose them to be in london yes where else can they be so well concealed and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty	3.0337180238831483
she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration	1.610935340465954
then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind	2.317659236910139
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mother s tea	2.331896610285408
this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away	2.0820369929922147
i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia	2.2511362973904614
you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it	2.871800146525833
and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner	3.5176217568272756
kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry	1.383143519590241
well well said he do not make yourself unhappy	1.4130661000741553
if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them	3.0412949187608818
chapter vii	1
two days after mr	1
bennet s return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask	2.7597074953563285
what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town	2.2251086413030414
hill in great astonishment don t you know there is an express come for master from mr	1.5602872142041666
gardiner he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter	4.6308633610319845
away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech	1.481266662216174
well and what news does it bring good or bad what is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it	2.7014022295452516
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand	1.2888581043925778
jane now came up	1
read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about	3.1175068104635217
gracechurch street monday august <num>	1
my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction	3.6485921137944985
soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were	3.125985063212507
the particulars i reserve till we meet	1.1097445044259893
it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married elizabeth read on i have seen them both	3.406541755702545
they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are	3.051627209635481
all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum	2.5446400961549873
you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr	1.653488802907458
wickham s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be	1.6177642424716807
the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune	2.611674950582312
if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement	1.826536334898033
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care	2.2530681322864243
send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly	2.1549387685508465
we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve	2.8743228922755097
she comes to us to day	1.4945992912206774
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on	2.5008681470422873
your s c	1
gardiner	1
is it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished	1.9984615286351584
can it be possible that he will marry her wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister	3.510020114420194
my dear father i congratulate you	1.6253377144089702
and have you answered the letter said elizabeth	1.7687856406931992
no but it must be done soon	2.582124653877365
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote	2.883963157268176
oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately	2.0776604809001653
consider how important every moment is in such a case	1.8046113155441488
let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself	1.7051602999004853
and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house	1.6758737198533693
and may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with	2.6613865908011887
complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little	2.59201209257421
and they must marry yet he is such a man yes yes they must marry	3.5769976230758553
there is nothing else to be done	2.54637173222536
but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him	2.6380402564966907
money my uncle cried jane what do you mean sir i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone	2.326443288090745
that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before	2.6739478681142215
his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncle s doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself	2.0559233355669786
a small sum could not do all this	1.6188534845059903
no said her father wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds	1.9873800023142238
i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship	3.202327212436622
ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid mr	1.4426573209319138
their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room	3.187004283356516
and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves	3.5691954632918956
how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful	2.1644460723538215
that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her	1.989300631088304
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced	2.28270304261823
he has children of his own and may have more	3.6849092037619027
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr	2.730238186039331
gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own	1.5989537325719876
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited	3.527174519662891
their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge	2.0300484816172895
by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy	2.9231914818606035
his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking	3.679979950688866
their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten	2.0693169670904807
their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget	1.3911720916436308
it is useless to talk of it	1.5471377364882901
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened	2.229774934248465
they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her	2.8769653086825104
he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied just as you please	1.3777519250962635
may we take my uncle s letter to read to her take whatever you like and get away	3.4189136128655204
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together	2.3699036743600987
mary and kitty were both with mrs	1.9296063012285571
bennet one communication would therefore do for all	1.9241931904350467
after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud	1.4497990093900515
bennet could hardly contain herself	1
as soon as jane had read mr	3.1668887798939505
gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance	1.783414361501765
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation	2.4101134480922743
to know that her daughter would be married was enough	4.941070832366069
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	1.87814440346148
my dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing	3.1179771632320095
how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly	3.1634936224445
lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her	2.3719292387991944
stay stay i will go myself	2.049763269504369
i will put on my things in a moment	1.6756181000923351
my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr	2.6196118647881708
gardiner s behaviour laid them all under	1.1839142401295428
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness	1.55080772117141
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr	1.7170196894298166
wickham with money	1
well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents	6.25187430270728
well i am so happy	1
in a short time i shall have a daughter married	6.000483270322403
wickham how well it sounds	1
and she was only sixteen last june	3.179486965086985
my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i can t write so i will dictate and you write for me	3.0312129618445014
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted	1.857345164707767
one day s delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual	3.061942460223515
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips	2.82622578385827
and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs	2.826753953982511
long	1
kitty run down and order the carriage	1.0662244916001484
an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure	2.1539346085626514
girls can i do any thing for you in meryton oh here comes hill	2.744742445812674
my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding	4.74632143376334
hill began instantly to express her joy	1.4141329827912605
she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained	2.945073502685201
chapter viii	1
bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him	2.2861833743608364
he now wished it more than ever	1.56535003820178
had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her	1.932271610548708
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place	2.454303664330953
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	3.5533469425667095
when first mr	1
bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son	1.7713604179065006
this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for	3.0362485011095224
bennet for many years after lydia s birth had been certain that he would	1.9771030776454306
this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving	1.900427231542193
bennet had no turn for economy and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income	1.728756943501327
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs	1.6280800014534063
bennet and the children	1
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents	2.260342885970821
this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr	3.158186271257746
bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him	1.2529190320210946
he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement	2.558957713913052
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands lydia s expences had been very little within that sum	2.4100309158599345
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible	2.165592019343022
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence	1.6647288346334699
his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution	1.5137598290017182
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her	2.13850234735974
the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood	1.742522690307683
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy	2.4050414775948505
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house	3.898570404214599
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain	2.5860552447495024
it was a fortnight since mrs	4.178654388200055
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph	1.1420565832856617
the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants	2.653841688170463
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance	2.2928658369366457
haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful	2.6147183879800107
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained	1.3364587807834651
but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs	1.6609896204540155
into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance	2.239583867766788
i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn	2.4865558357854183
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr	1.1819287911506458
bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs	2.477950655970204
bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter	1.9072138249140036
bennet could hardly comprehend it	1
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr	5.6385245053816675
darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot	3.4823408584957685
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means	1.8073124976793282
not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them	1.6413507285287574
had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr	3.2113921584158747
darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned	2.9966642402226906
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink	5.121528725747113
the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this	2.770538527155098
she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what	1.416385214203613
she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence	2.3157305986123218
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet	3.7129166664683466
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex	1.8288386370441707
but while he was mortal there must be a triumph	2.50757112290311
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her	2.2491924608395317
his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes	2.1000283462471834
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance	2.7627538942968157
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was	1.4673167002091645
an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family	3.8219769552939162
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine	2.518064071726952
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture	1.4735811465257482
gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	1.465112008477848
to mr	1
bennet s acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again	2.7774661437563934
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr	2.6264323561737237
wickham had resolved on quitting the militia	3.116484387767792
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on	4.149648737303372
and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my niece s	2.3590067923783176
it is mr	1
wickham s intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army	2.848228481092845
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom	3.554022460145319
he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent	1.7229750568407736
i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr	2.210824392353279
wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself	1.4540983705565242
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information	1.8558194609371477
he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us	3.2932334750340466
haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week	1.3314938262490466
they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs	2.3439402561923823
gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south	2.7258824183342893
she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother	2.0108530772724054
your s c	1
gardiner	1
bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham s removal from the shire as clearly as mr	4.412690671866457
gardiner could do	1
but mrs	1
bennet was not so well pleased with it	2.2296017952295424
lydia s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites	2.683048608754627
she is so fond of mrs	1.2303150964159177
forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much	2.346835222348859
the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment	2.1249578104536604
his daughter s request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative	3.52637039424956
but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sister s feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished	3.22167573906306
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north	4.243150767575633
when mr	1
bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn	4.944960990276975
chapter ix	1
their sister s wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself	3.861187258577326
the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinner time	4.2644070248827735
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure	2.403955625454706
they came	1
smiles decked the face of mrs	2.1027849403324996
bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy	1.8923282262736991
lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room	1.9706377846283585
her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness	1.5022195712650492
their reception from mr	1
his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips	1.1688134951819045
the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him	2.6598870900986262
elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked	1.6793039305110664
lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless	1.0112869622748557
she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there	2.6348455781534112
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all	4.001649244962024
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man	1.7974346158121486
she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour	2.3244778369453356
there was no want of discourse	2.0552535513056784
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies	2.310208639003396
nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world	2.3989931344986593
only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time	2.1397937036371038
good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was	3.651489910410541
her father lifted up his eyes	1.0321941509387957
jane was distressed	1
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the people here abouts know i am married to day i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing	2.678392342802858
elizabeth could bear it no longer	1.3639726398765581
she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour	2.240266842404897
her ease and good spirits increased	1.207363256313771
she longed to see mrs	1
wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to mrs	2.294344465347997
hill and the two housemaids	1
well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband is not he a charming man i am sure my sisters must all envy me	5.111094534810644
they must all go to brighton	1.4398699211433816
that is the place to get husbands	2.06281443073182
what a pity it is mamma we did not all go	2.008939747777802
very true and if i had my will we should	2.8473128782793395
but my dear lydia i don t at all like your going such a way off	2.2899812057750446
must it be so oh lord yes there is nothing in that	2.2587219957289832
i shall like it of all things	2.172430730643667
you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us	2.0042806263918354
we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all	2.395048698699044
i should like it beyond any thing said her mother	3.198085409681729
i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands	3.751462097257216
wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight	3.3343041777842415
no one but mrs	1
bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home	3.4125334618139176
these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not	1.5017755316812043
wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydia s for him	4.665232017277863
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion	3.405731840675285
lydia was exceedingly fond of him	1.9205484257650685
one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe	3.577321596523471
you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it	3.6237116127304954
are not you curious to hear how it was managed no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject	2.2231896815307692
la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off	6.625711007756745
we were married you know at st	1.669418897665236
clement s because wickham s lodgings were in that parish	1.5183990056870955
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock	2.391843299667201
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church	6.202428150332554
well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted	2.8275147601138597
and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon	3.535847631730077
however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham	3.9382838275487004
well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them	4.13446889894766
if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight	2.473027761489436
not one party or scheme or any thing	1.7315893970021305
well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr	1.939152025353151
stone	1
and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it	1.8417820568139616
but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out	3.023732640253774
however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr	2.8117436569735714
darcy might have done as well	2.00584127134365
oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know	2.7088125178850504
but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it	1.556650671256394
i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject	2.5773542026163656
you may depend upon my seeking no further	1.632458585055051
oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions	2.224104317767808
thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry	4.50488400103463
on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away	2.1995563624551147
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information	2.9259304022838144
darcy had been at her sister s wedding	3.626921171633343
it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go	2.1231616297742377
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none	2.445466204862871
those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable	1.3042601231120572
she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended	2.748564147736831
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time	2.737100552857602
pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance	2.542627643128752
not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out	2.8290030259649996
jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante	1.8464518692070788
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could	3.468710035630473
she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial	2.3865654540202694
<num>	1
my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you	2.055863477344074
don t think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side	3.063163256390288
if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence	1.7228342388213125
your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done	2.429320887171995
but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit	2.1003604460251117
he came to tell mr	1
gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr	5.499833982154505
wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once	3.2489171046546494
from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them	2.1384911765393166
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him	2.6520611702498527
if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him	3.6201359690693007
he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us	3.5116604303146564
younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what	2.3655675551069884
she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings	1.5406364542164188
this mrs	1
younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town	2.8745659561950934
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted	4.063218290869345
she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found	2.5074651087706363
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her	3.183201573044804
at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction	3.4330156137686028
they were in street	1
he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia	1.3279980729396867
his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go	2.831366635204294
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was	1.735549231322141
she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham	2.5648380646793743
she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when	2.776352589441404
since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design	2.4384606297515323
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone	2.4367044568576244
he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it	2.3264933169340103
he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on	3.345092294860644
darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once	2.8482403472648965
though mr	1
bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage	3.8753097477938003
but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country	3.0794802319015306
under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief	2.073041079669459
they met several times for there was much to be discussed	2.374029109746107
wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable	3.069744574820086
every thing being settled between them mr	1.7174038173699329
darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home	2.670857663759921
gardiner could not be seen and mr	4.148258898836767
darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning	3.159077146739232
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former	2.81202370102853
he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business	4.757938677087291
on saturday he came again	1
your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together	4.347263419204941
they met again on sunday and then i saw him too	3.0038637024306913
it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn	2.5786602210066105
but our visitor was very obstinate	1.0918955757611113
i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all	1.6946036703577618
he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one	2.4437368169215747
they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved	3.6011064066206924
but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due	2.120500418259433
but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most	2.7927745368433694
you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people	2.7302904949544526
his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased	1.8109467112657907
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above	9.284633222794893
but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair	1.8658369718201717
when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish	3.827917923124091
i believe i have now told you every thing	2.1228459903541315
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure	3.0934947333795355
lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house	2.3945003298898535
he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain	3.1014206462599994
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family	2.3992140446398795
if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen	4.911392901619786
i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her	3.418600758639068
darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding	1.861915951536616
he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday	2.7363338821540086
his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire	2.4801652051910055
his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him	1.6756910825236855
i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name	1.142364515565549
but slyness seems the fashion	1
pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p	1.958552705798017
a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing	1.9186859525907838
but i must write no more	2.182524260200384
the children have been wanting me this half hour	1.632340156752221
your s very sincerely m	1
gardiner	1
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share	2.203823577147196
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr	1.9339962629950107
darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce	2.5239769835454062
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem	2.4562534148119712
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her	2.3802239668361005
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham	2.061314611347492
brother in law of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the connection	2.006618406125844
he had to be sure done much	3.98475333644958
she was ashamed to think how much	1.4580641496573714
but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief	2.159626257320291
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned	2.475801691868031
it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return	3.5884774333764846
they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him	3.4063260746485486
oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him	1.6746374463291325
for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him	2.832261030094883
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself	2.983762330560365
she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again	2.8219014661926347
it was hardly enough but it pleased her	5.3253442073110655
she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr	1.71812474110917
darcy and herself	1
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one s approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham	2.386282362483945
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said he as he joined her	2.3934856401104176
you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome	2.1223633908359383
i should be sorry indeed if it were	1.7864815083889887
we were always good friends and now we are better	2.9308854363259194
true	1
are the others coming out i do not know	1.4858921357744472
bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton	3.0808222998469676
and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley	3.6354903258397937
i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle	3.782401772600666
and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of me	3.2481727019854225
but of course she did not mention my name to you	2.6078276695933225
yes she did	1
and what did she say that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well	2.4678852126685773
at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented	2.3831331173272385
certainly he replied biting his lips	1.009491658474601
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month	2.474849371178805
we passed each other several times	1.022654201157057
i wonder what he can be doing there	2.120378723348466
perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth	2.732789328766077
it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year	2.3996839268069006
undoubtedly	1
did you see him while you were at lambton i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had	2.9636833489066676
yes he introduced us to his sister	1.2081167148401102
and do you like her very much	2.650344406623471
i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two	2.022988639705358
when i last saw her she was not very promising	2.5065672855418404
i am very glad you liked her	1.7275649008536773
i hope she will turn out well	2.7985436063422617
i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age	2.310803449307284
i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had	2.2046282120816687
a most delightful place excellent parsonage house it would have suited me in every respect	2.2987382230555
how should you have liked making sermons exceedingly well	1.2666470900666724
i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing	2.174037270661407
one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be	3.633525742999255
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron	3.6256798487566813
you have	1
yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember	3.7636122183076237
i did hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly	2.6469940230842837
you did and it was not wholly without foundation	4.222836130037399
you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it	1.9154135078169248
wickham we are brother and sister you know	2.464885182485439
do not let us quarrel about the past	1.2745110013613745
in future i hope we shall be always of one mind	2.4979981563302744
she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house	2.041166437300101
chapter xi	1
wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet	3.0508027073213406
the day of his and lydia s departure soon came and mrs	5.114313147373344
bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth	3.2369568049689903
not these two or three years perhaps	1.664748669051455
write to me very often my dear	1.6597422919487845
as often as i can	1
but you know married women have never much time for writing	1.5969922134261858
wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife s	1.3562156608637226
he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things	1.1486689851459069
he is as fine a fellow said mr	2.232467415445624
bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw	3.1101727786140736
he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all	1.2203891510792897
i am prodigiously proud of him	1.3129749057934197
i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law	1.5537126742723506
bennet very dull for several days	1.2536939349189358
i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends	3.2330963914309905
one seems so forlorn without them	1.0039069453627145
this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth	2.113329000189038
it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single	1.3067626075709722
it is no such thing	1
lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far off	2.1713688084730873
if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon	3.6608291790507805
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation	2.0235800824149317
bennet was quite in the fidgets	1.4629499518839173
she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns	2.2741067596149533
well well and so mr	1
bingley is coming down sister for mrs	1.3695497284887286
philips first brought her the news	1.0659954792425004
well so much the better	1
he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again	2.354753545247918
but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it	3.168190377765536
and who knows what may happen but that is nothing to us	1.7822432978351215
and so is it quite certain he is coming you may depend on it replied the other for mrs	2.3693279265605627
nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true	3.0723352605663536
he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday	1.2369164047976264
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour	5.58214102066182
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed	4.0895972282066175
but don t imagine it was from any silly cause	1.5955549553481922
i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at	3.7388277628268503
i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain	2.109560346364447
i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him	5.5746348669707935
elizabeth did not know what to make of it	3.583807820650042
had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend s permission or being bold enough to come without it	2.9512921352326553
yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation i will leave him to himself	2.1161282266317403
in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it	4.112269370686107
they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them	1.899016745019365
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again	1.856244566656362
as soon as ever mr	1
bingley comes my dear said mrs	1.0592951639672192
bennet you will wait on him of course	3.151482030956975
no no	1
you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters	2.1456762917755037
but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again	2.795166039916097
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield	2.278142312742975
tis an etiquette i despise said he	1.0968784420023232
if he wants our society let him seek it	1.1814034898835115
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again	2.1277931297650325
well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him	2.1521332710950216
but however that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined	2.7147281050590033
we must have mrs	1
long and the gouldings soon	1
that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him	3.000080145749263
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr	3.2581247071354658
as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister	2.7316019550832875
it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of	4.82910293750073
happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power	4.932175329835712
bingley arrived	1
bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could	2.5982879468058493
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before	1.6200749475244918
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house	3.138892707103804
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy	1.320237571496175
jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw mr	4.818439935474783
darcy with him and sat down again by her sister	2.093729226910151
there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know	3.242447187656332
la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before	2.3626546465154887
good gracious mr	1
darcy and so it does i vow	1.1607097025058686
well any friend of mr	1
bingley s will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him	1.9812329572436156
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern	1.7596421533782298
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter	2.2421923580054597
both sisters were uncomfortable enough	1
each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr	3.0660565972852476
darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr	3.6805401946173837
bingley s friend without being heard by either of them	2.89831962897398
gardiner s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him	1.8724096077241024
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley	2.980486328914187
her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire	2.5953500651006114
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken	2.5089369300374758
but she would not be secure	2.788430158292895
jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected	1.191448420595267
on the gentlemen s appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance	1.9275462583379723
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command	1.9326302623037068
she had ventured only one glance at darcy	1.353065653578394
he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley	3.958878701756094
but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt	4.27333220669108
it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture	2.5332324456165045
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed	1.7949045042791179
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend	1.8849850504062264
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied	1.6529714621651874
darcy after enquiring of her how mr	1.2932436920981538
gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing	3.2957120646008207
he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire	3.6404579149496117
there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself	7.485404278133165
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground	2.852211869008116
she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so	1.545608485247265
could i expect it to be otherwise said she	3.037113771485877
yet why did he come she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak	3.3151379870995226
she enquired after his sister but could do no more	2.8313048553354836
it is a long time mr	3.1948019673282895
bingley since you went away said mrs	1.8213060996904706
bennet	1
i began to be afraid you would never come back again	2.591559842808747
miss lucas is married and settled	1.4843585990248511
and one of my own daughters	2.9062969754322125
i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers	3.097025094794878
it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be	2.836217819939598
it was only said lately george wickham esq	1.7430007218398778
to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing	3.602727002094268
it was my brother gardiner s drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it	2.5224292825686225
did you see it bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations	3.3034742713640277
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes	1.0048406856931151
how mr	1
darcy looked therefore she could not tell	1.8596802824568606
it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr	2.663214562665535
bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me	3.2165441698417623
they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long	3.077790647917332
his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars	2.7663500209031784
thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves	2.733054609257326
elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr	2.140651875255806
darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat	3.787559458656619
it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present	2.226750546404205
a few weeks he believed	1
bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr	2.6497035155564634
bennet s manor	1
elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion	2.019831113511305
at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion	3.1728519383849187
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them	3.5072174770542848
their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover	3.1717158301101795
when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention	2.2070642538667165
he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty	2.520116060668501
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever	2.535081159564589
but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent	3.2839902046263214
when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs	2.376327537561046
bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time	2.7983425374296687
bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned	1.9296273645107276
i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement	4.089876834140085
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business	3.3312859173793132
they then went away	1
chapter xii	1
as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more	2.500059260218326
darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her	1.9298171925806906
why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	2.0152406881397873
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if he no longer cares for me why silent teazing teazing man i will think no more about him	2.2956206129548513
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth	2.0264910043591664
now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy	2.0740595745930475
i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming	2.4855803978626665
i am glad he dines here on tuesday	2.0000498408798584
it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance	1.4678271701929995
yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly	1.5682806910964666
i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever	6.940676534210944
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs	2.804956967610691
bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hour s visit had revived	4.208141924212276
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time	3.299141898171302
when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister	2.7786081470282684
her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself	1.9857753090715995
on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided	2.151038808185454
he placed himself by her	1
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend	1.283121017951668
he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr	3.540334871915591
darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm	2.6581768284016656
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured	2.6157066708075547
though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour	3.6980915601811684
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour	3.682405281065585
darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them	1.964315986820273
he was on one side of her mother	3.2535551747863876
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage	1.966380537506075
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did	2.749011508076939
her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family	2.2363434909692987
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance	2.6715280054066324
anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil	1.9987187405393894
the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair	2.8493958176421774
and on the gentlemen s approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shan t come and part us i am determined	2.152679222922344
we want none of them do we darcy had walked away to another part of the room	1.7991970339337438
she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still yes she will remain there till christmas	2.5193762409072464
and quite alone have all her friends left her mrs	1.7514091614101854
annesley is with her	1
the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks	2.326844012552628
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success	4.201263045882738
he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again he walked away	2.469779044321229
when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party	2.5783875818306603
she now lost every expectation of pleasure	1.8992215768927736
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	4.2688180140387315
bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them	3.0918001122558985
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you	2.548014827940201
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw	1.6922223391350717
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas s last week and even mr	2.7965450225205597
darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least	3.2430691921700223
and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty	2.670794296985721
long said so too for i asked her whether you did not	1.45155308197877
and what do you think she said besides ah mrs	1.9013199289548632
bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last	2.6311655962790286
she did indeed	1
i do think mrs	1
long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously	1.8181706298792664
bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals	4.0076847528751935
the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other	1.4471508213482833
i hope we may often meet again	2.730202572159456
elizabeth smiled	1
lizzy you must not do so	3.2295293770794893
you must not suspect me	1
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection	2.0235570692695903
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man	2.5471721378727223
you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment	2.316312077405534
how hard it is in some cases to be believed and how impossible in others but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge that is a question which i hardly know how to answer	2.28675478968373
we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing	1.3917567685664083
chapter xiii	1
a few days after this visit mr	2.269657111736222
bingley called again and alone	1
his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time	2.30137922301782
he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits	1.9312058267853298
bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	3.0352563602182303
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky	2.1277297368134795
he should be particularly happy at any time c	1.9062097879123816
and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them	1.6232721689555376
can you come to morrow yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity	2.861379232949224
in ran mrs	1
bennet to her daughter s room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down	2.3569740386234432
he is come mr	1
bingley is come	1
he is indeed	1
make haste make haste	1
here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown	1.7811514124683094
never mind miss lizzy s hair	1.1094505436556108
we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago	5.010203050102705
oh hang kitty what has she to do with it come be quick be quick where is your sash my dear but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters	2.9725527222428982
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening	2.0525858660837404
after tea mr	1
two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs	2.2552884702310103
bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them	1.8657187256302532
i did not wink at you	1.997478315848849
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it	1.9147173484407944
in a few minutes mrs	1
bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you	3.1910102097892126
elizabeth was forced to go	1
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall	4.158480629100472
kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room	1.9561867746078454
bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual	1.485045580532013
bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter	1.5256222887517912
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter	2.4563818670483397
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs	2.0745004195326695
bennet s means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband	1.7535001844101579
after this day jane said no more of her indifference	1.7805820415896247
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr	3.101596660734482
darcy returned within the stated time	1.4383383374101453
seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s concurrence	1.8105718679582752
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr	1.1818384706672285
bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on	1.8674299519604978
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected	2.4340452280087823
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him	2.3842494721323604
bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs	2.960469010897407
bennet s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter	2.1119592980423256
elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes	3.0227195954454675
but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her	2.3237125507155105
on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all	2.302276535687408
their situation was awkward enough but her s she thought was still worse	1.920845727255128
not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room	3.734225616937398
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world	1.592386156995018
tis too much she added by far too much	1.3785325013896845
i do not deserve it	1
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane	3.1894080200941928
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present	2.654222020987829
i must go instantly to my mother she cried	2.582229197155169
i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself	3.0125440544699185
he is gone to my father already	1.8682470488543412
oh lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty	2.5890382792185918
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation	1.8070227659350933
and this said she is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest most reasonable end in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose	2.6380903439162298
where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door	3.9385330684246904
with my mother up stairs	1
she will be down in a moment i dare say	3.9388416021417045
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship	1.8047720820014974
they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane s perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself	2.7365245963227776
bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr	2.2183238288154685
bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was	2.272229103299115
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you	3.2822224490725236
you will be a very happy woman	4.9892088671374895
jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness	2.0374644935737147
you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled	3.0943249623942273
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together	5.716051330785531
your tempers are by no means unlike	1.8211182386382143
you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income	1.8870945917572852
i hope not so	1
exceed their income my dear mr	1.0743216502920512
bennet cried his wife what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more	2.2287511274967895
then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night	2.481135133628493
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together	3.6485015608563462
oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen wickham lydia were all forgotten	1.7373170228293155
jane was beyond competition her favourite child	1.4569057548374895
at that moment she cared for no other	2.5903129410453283
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter	3.6691798370220696
in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief	3.3334551285456664
he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed it possible	2.8821518043135574
i suspected as much replied elizabeth	1.363403335875999
but how did he account for it it must have been his sister s doing	2.110198848308571
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects	3.2908403946027365
that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter	2.601576526898911
good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard	2.2654913408043353
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities	1.780834000994646
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried jane	1.6334206763002264
oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you	2.394873768047675
till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness	2.899353541720371
no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr	2.287123966955789
collins in time	1
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret	3.2762051132106524
bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs	1.1957251486254412
philips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton	3.144072866587423
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	2.597225676468916
one morning about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn	3.1653159702769855
it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours	5.101424784643299
the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them	1.8281141735648867
as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery	2.8262755129618555
they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered	2.0962282453861687
it was lady catherine de bourgh	1.0053933159057677
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs	3.6038768862100437
bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt	2.9903250265296197
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word	3.044776292860557
bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness	2.152311303443595
after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet	4.682143061161724
that lady i suppose is your mother	1.7301174456737005
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was	1.0085380684121306
and that i suppose is one of your sisters	2.575335734426883
yes madam said mrs	1
bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine	2.8914703325552145
she is my youngest girl but one	1.1134457410756333
my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family	2.6394129947949434
you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence	2.1929079266379072
it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas s	4.223008656818786
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west	3.3687307437927276
and mrs	1
collins well	1
yes very well	1
i saw them the night before last	2.412366625285172
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling	2.623088650903215
bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn	2.2916274269591392
i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company	3.854165512766317
go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks	2.167467294365942
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage	2.6880971871597668
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs	1.3702204790087762
as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on	1.8689003160787703
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it	2.0593258420419818
your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come	1.8261190383890062
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	1
indeed you are mistaken madam	1
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here	4.087975453388445
miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with	2.906255512749701
but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so	1.8078125577285904
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago	1.5536400766060492
i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr	2.9756330149806844
darcy	1
if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far	3.2587728110227108
your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence	4.0573035797369705
and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship	2.3937200069213773
you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer	3.4370261649565306
this is not to be borne	2.5714735754762716
miss bennet i insist on being satisfied	1.2999620637596734
it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason	3.4740944501284563
you may have drawn him in	2.477994583546717
if i have i shall be the last person to confess it	5.2175087199196355
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns	2.8309473513107464
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit	2.3403238038661094
let me be rightly understood	1
this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place	1.8246939511378257
no never	1
darcy is engaged to my daughter	2.057476985790294
now what have you to say only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me	3.256001102701618
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind	2.4967551086544826
from their infancy they have been intended for each other	1.8459860801201715
it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of her s	4.196916984639584
while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin yes and i had heard it before	2.8291672090681326
but what is that to me if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh	3.199841355856239
you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage	1.8290040871599824
its completion depended on others	1
if mr	1
darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it	2.1863942256003486
yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all	1.9843252733157022
you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him	1.5917672042252062
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us	1.9056012637276798
but the wife of mr	1
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine	2.521259223550722
obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score let us sit down	2.2658349134971414
you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it	2.6459397083212
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment	2.424048089767177
that will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me	2.333455434858251
i will not be interrupted	1
hear me in silence	1
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other	2.098951380479588
their fortune on both sides is splendid	2.6825128181456033
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune	2.2022959783301137
is this to be endured but it must not shall not be	2.1762888096282045
if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up	2.4366659798147614
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere	1.748999836909702
he is a gentleman i am a gentleman s daughter so far we are equal	1.9518905789910501
true	1
but who was your mother who are your uncles and aunts do not imagine me ignorant of their condition	2.2007762239410877
tell me once for all are you engaged to him though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moment s deliberation i am not	3.6061590703990336
lady catherine seemed pleased	1
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished	2.8844619509812426
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman	2.99894003342009
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede	2.516368644847315
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require	3.8519488002667446
and i certainly never shall give it	1.7219228892713296
your ladyship wants mr	1
darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged	2.639493799019878
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine	3.2214267673916797
i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject	2.072199560943593
not so hasty if you please	1.1640761303539526
i have by no means done	2.912566869787477
to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add	3.152975012539176
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement	1.6739096602336887
i know it all that the young man s marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles	2.131358457134152
and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister is her husband is the son of his late father s steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered	2.2738049562747267
you have insulted me in every possible method	1.199825390231852
and she rose as she spoke	1.6636972432641006
lady catherine rose also and they turned back	1.1455467678088804
her ladyship was highly incensed	1
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody lady catherine i have nothing farther to say	2.8229439674835284
you know my sentiments	1
you are then resolved to have him i have said no such thing	3.3829908455317583
i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me	2.4654595750697204
it is well	1
you refuse then to oblige me	1.1370305041969557
you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude	1.0989501392911911
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world	3.383636549956239
darcy	1
and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn	3.1660919493808906
and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well	1.832000405662874
i shall now know how to act	2.225861788687145
do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified	2.12196879447938
i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point	2.3164553239755143
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet	2.0737405798711235
i send no compliments to your mother	1.8144583654003696
you deserve no such attention	1
elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself	2.584822600444227
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs	2.0733086048223233
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself	2.513988600493498
she did not choose it said her daughter she would go	3.1211536916809717
she is a very fine looking woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well	2.415542313820085
she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you	2.173721792775014
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible	2.97353922382285
chapter xv	1
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly	2.3733105929250917
lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr	2.2338646635716506
darcy	1
it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea	3.7208427947986693
and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time	2.4343254537670957
in revolving lady catherine s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference	2.2549208238786993
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side	2.994675254846751
with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning	1.8462809224022785
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him	2.3825949634896
in that case he would return no more	2.1203013929080123
lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way	5.372830685853575
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it	2.4986180666409417
i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy	1.9393691638072657
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs	3.3044387269814237
bennet s curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject	2.2443229098584503
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	4.527045071164085
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room	3.222077252787759
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held	3.9681261603969387
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations	1.6930794664025794
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down	2.050286651550186
he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly	2.6446659337210203
as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents	1.1758938190202326
i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony	3.76412927881271
the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious	2.767787385077291
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer	3.4121808833831895
this letter is from mr	1
collins	1
collins and what can he have to say something very much to the purpose of course	3.44170372906895
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases	2.268263571654025
what relates to yourself is as follows	1.4852577555103768
collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority	2.1682314706210475
your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land	2.500198043551141
can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage	1.762849658248792
yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of	1.8263178290901911
have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out	2.395656843891813
my motive for cautioning you is as follows	1.053173853732758
could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related mr	2.332039461689431
darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile	2.7813858704975924
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her	1.3633044312861917
pray read on	1
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match	2.964514716807425
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned	2.7662024267677534
collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known	2.4484208602125372
i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married	1.9907602011786625
it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it	2.7662262967279196
that is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch	2.692314348364051
but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it	1.591571557881237
you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report	1.7309168882465695
for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted	2.328826140798791
but it is so strange yes that is what makes it amusing	1.8388108507774892
collins s correspondence for any consideration	1.8057456153147544
nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law	2.527456634444428
and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report did she call to refuse her consent to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it	2.280413676307512
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not	3.178434425715395
it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried	1.606190718103409
her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr	2.3231801365172955
darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much	2.3030844049723638
chapter xvi	1
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr	2.4749622796953448
bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit	2.8859064019532368
the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs	1.019942999642998
bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out	3.6725234763807095
it was agreed to	1
bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together	2.3790070814425293
bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them	2.450763892384818
very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same	2.3693048576017453
they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone	1.9072677542135306
darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s	2.285208289506897
were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express	3.8718634980231283
i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness	2.2879539685205548
i did not think mrs	1
gardiner was so little to be trusted	1.50940828095018
you must not blame my aunt	1.9502329955534736
lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars	4.037362191646988
if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone	1.594875442218093
but your family owe me nothing	1.0310927536075503
much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you	4.274275699745377
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word	1.6696795018400081
after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me	2.206500427607027
my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever	2.096300532738413
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances	2.5795613298935405
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable	3.603019117981721
they walked on without knowing in what direction	1.6325470336530268
there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects	3.5993830464133363
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship s apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give	2.7851837351039057
but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise	2.8486247147977255
it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before	2.395528181390173
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly	2.2957074236802053
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that	1.4317757132168232
what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof	2.33782623006296
i cannot think of it without abhorrence	3.1854643941765604
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth	1.596235477384723
the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility	1.899911426130374
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself	1.679685867369492
the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me	2.856859187145288
your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner	1.2578981648630503
those were your words	1
you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice	2.566762378109193
i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression	1.9007025293660142
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way	4.213098171112087
i can easily believe it	1
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did	2.1900151157927876
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me	3.288851542624797
oh do not repeat what i then said	1.8102671607963572
these recollections will not do at all	2.1096139591960954
darcy mentioned his letter	1
did it said he did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed	2.2344643676793496
i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary	2.9624602716481085
i hope you have destroyed the letter	1.3280221492474131
there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again	2.638582912972666
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me	1.4921377202319046
the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies	1.8482341592945601
when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit	2.2419958803734876
the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so	1.9798183985936704
but think no more of the letter	3.4096361351851887
the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten	3.9021496252686463
you must learn some of my philosophy	1.629817938144718
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure	3.8147824738833784
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind	1.4771624756233985
your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance	1.8955453060664893
but with me it is not so	2.2414221671878063
i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle	2.5948319599647163
i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit	1.1874682026861227
by you i was properly humbled	1.5021863312838937
i came to you without a doubt of my reception	1.7694412816739584
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	1.2407741105797032
had you then persuaded yourself that i should indeed i had	1.998450795547559
my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you	2.13420497593547
i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong	1.902596928185011
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley	2.258498767463953
you blamed me for coming no indeed i felt nothing but surprise	1.725020039062719
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you	1.6777105174744409
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due	2.0367696042226866
my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to	2.885035877202388
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you	2.8842186158045617
he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend	2.7141570976998644
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home	2.8519184962539206
what could become of mr	1
bingley and jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs	2.5591957694216725
darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it	2.7401099405054476
not at all	1
when i went away i felt that it would soon happen	2.819075433501678
i guessed as much	1
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago	5.351531494416008
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent	2.152921702551824
his surprise was great	1
he had never had the slightest suspicion	2.416509967861152
i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together	3.5268639117585954
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend	1.7795360719406979
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring from the former	2.653895588414853
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection	2.692534697053237
it did	1
bingley is most unaffectedly modest	1
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy	1.6205317352723394
i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him	2.67501968057731
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him	2.8319982016721426
he was angry	1
but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments	3.1957627544903646
elizabeth longed to observe that mr	2.5805927616990547
bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself	1.957435709408296
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin	2.635361425032348
in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house	4.2415433244809115
in the hall they parted	1
chapter xvii	1
my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table	4.039731695490622
she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge	3.6265527230614025
she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth	1.8421330118811872
the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary	1.2424054395092685
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent	1.147473257252294
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her	2.403696722687349
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	2.651948261250095
at night she opened her heart to jane	2.37069508411978
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet s general habits she was absolutely incredulous here	1.714468331209473
you are joking lizzy	1
this cannot be engaged to mr	4.368775291031894
darcy no no you shall not deceive me	1.3853632497126624
i know it to be impossible	2.733126625408776
this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not	2.352922221194203
yet indeed i am in earnest	2.594826615756682
i speak nothing but the truth	1.1799137176123935
he still loves me and we are engaged	1.3189822900862382
jane looked at her doubtingly	1
oh lizzy it cannot be	1
you know nothing of the matter	1.4136774915260242
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now	3.3023741671028835
but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable	1.2622873972368307
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself	3.395487127241988
miss bennet still looked all amazement	1.2338533935876594
elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth	1.391443921386077
good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried jane	3.826363740887503
my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him there can be no doubt of that	3.108880666353512
it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world	3.25166779255157
but are you pleased jane shall you like to have such a brother very very much	5.352461730584549
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight	1.1222334456457252
but we considered it we talked of it as impossible	1.3868336933831917
and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do any thing rather than marry without affection	1.4537461437420127
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all	4.910697727944143
what do you mean why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley	2.704136539241218
i am afraid you will be angry	3.2236360827407453
my dearest sister now be be serious	1.7945456360885168
i want to talk very seriously	1.5350057054354258
let me know every thing that i am to know without delay	5.060366168628076
will you tell me how long you have loved him it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began	2.0633584849139677
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley	2.3605413925515855
another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment	2.0994243745460976
when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish	1.9058215381698933
i always had a value for him	1.606711178126499
were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingley s friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me	3.272885398832234
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know of it to another not to you	2.982658749161845
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy	1.184667850273087
she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend	2.9368785761874414
but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage	2.901336769747042
good gracious cried mrs	1
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud mr	3.0038057153311737
bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day i advise mr	1.729585757939026
darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs	1.7076970427106664
bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning	1.140695737406249
it is a nice long walk and mr	2.2048075464222787
darcy has never seen the view	3.025687417906934
it may do very well for the others replied mr	4.267247229381979
bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty	4.074906055601467
wont it kitty kitty owned that she had rather stay at home	3.3192869234920193
bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself	2.7764615662694987
but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane s sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then	2.4345053224112325
so do not put yourself to inconvenience	1.074108608523048
during their walk it was resolved that mr	1.500012162517952
bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening	2.310355331194423
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother s	2.2666795963436237
she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	2.3687366776893644
but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr	2.273742971450417
darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation	1.5811163432406972
in the evening soon after mr	4.4205859228711555
bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr	3.035071914534719
darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme	1.4245910161783173
she did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr	2.675480647210632
darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile	3.819628596319177
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library	2.873546464996759
she was gone directly	1
lizzy said he what are you doing are you out of your senses to be accepting this man have not you always hated him how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr	2.4684011330117848
darcy	1
or in other words you are determined to have him	2.584555806354645
he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane	2.429081241488229
but will they make you happy have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference none at all	1.4613763733621772
we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him	3.127938611376115
i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him	3.677022868345773
indeed he has no improper pride	1.4768406653896389
he is perfectly amiable	1
you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms	3.406642584775087
lizzy said her father i have given him my consent	2.9238979317516245
he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask	3.040655822293115
i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him	2.600469472442515
but let me advise you to think better of it	2.6402456351911785
i know your disposition lizzy	1
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior	2.01406077875923
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage	1.7683037057292599
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery	1.134466770119829
my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life	2.2830743778869804
you know not what you are about	3.8886408676574606
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr	1.700319284887809
darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match	2.407872741288916
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say	2.5285993012914556
if this be the case he deserves you	2.29303721004908
i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy	3.6019454021252497
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr	1.5919459107994183
darcy had voluntarily done for lydia	1.3641600364925839
he heard her with astonishment	1
this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellow s debts and got him his commission so much the better	1.9762167711233345
it will save me a world of trouble and economy	1.3979202280729184
had it been your uncle s doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way	2.837766067787984
i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter	3.9171378702292654
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr	1.6727557120136183
collins s letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure	1.961413083327954
every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time	1.9695312512547434
when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication	3.1343611684281805
its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs	1.5458019104352787
bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable	2.7758443486067224
nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them	3.169409608132374
she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself	1.3278820993588372
darcy who would have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have jane s is nothing to it nothing at all	2.0747956499339444
i am so pleased so happy	1.73020628906726
such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before	2.0441424825871453
i hope he will overlook it	1.8638883143806884
dear dear lizzy	1
a house in town every thing that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me	1.5102771753232989
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away	2.271237132448806
but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her	6.2674202719654675
my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else ten thousand a year and very likely more tis as good as a lord and a special licence	1.8580573037260006
you must and shall be married by a special licence	1.6531331909793323
darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow	3.3301803205248652
this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for	2.3584119084811515
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs	3.1619995205900353
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr	1.9313824361477534
bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem	2.337645776801825
i admire all my three sons in law highly said he	1.3726801327971438
wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane s	3.485401438571657
chapter xviii	1
elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr	1.5782929041422133
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her	1.904108675505079
how could you begin said she	1.8831559344589286
i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation	3.3151447837899726
it is too long ago	1
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun	4.363066885807817
my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not	2.213352411089114
now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence for the liveliness of your mind i did	1.6507061688982443
you may as well call it impertinence at once	1.7971277544251552
it was very little less	1
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention	2.529663444044559
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone	1.497476198647423
i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them	1.51819941620711
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you	2.5514435333087233
to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love	2.207743055172493
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means	3.0637076197733824
my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last	2.9148859149991533
what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement	1.822741412581199
and so was i	1
you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner	2.4868010252582855
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself	4.001198229285091
i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect	2.2884503734058765
too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do	2.891020251021788
you need not distress yourself	1
the moral will be perfectly fair	1.2442727707834909
lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts	2.1787317131405595
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude	1.9762829596864353
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s	3.0479238891335494
lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use	1.9086105225108674
but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequence my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me	2.940332426296057
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth	2.5359207566167092
but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly	3.4598891686249567
and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did	2.1772369429689906
but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected	2.762055375174287
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr	1.203121069502162
darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs	3.0082168605278903
gardiner s long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write	2.690536688097499
you supposed more than really existed	1.014638448155724
but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err	2.035940562162434
you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last	1.9947025202218047
i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes	4.50023344059283
how could i be so silly as to wish it your idea of the ponies is delightful	2.060302346314864
we will go round the park every day	1.9772571606029472
i am the happiest creature in the world	1.3620634743821092
perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice	1.7935989625407849
i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh	2.3989516553646477
darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me	3.5357802786913264
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas	3.1108253926313054
your s c	1
darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr	4.113304700887044
bennet sent to mr	1
collins in reply to his last	3.1375748413737563
dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations	1.6884491793053225
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr	2.2913268666978515
darcy	1
console lady catherine as well as you can	2.9543358231660126
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew	2.239280717753397
he has more to give	1
your s sincerely c	1
she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard	2.3304743626128883
jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved	2.3639334294520022
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it	2.275340665845108
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	2.3054541275687988
before any answer could arrive from mr	1.0212583772499064
collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge	3.335209614235955
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident	1.4659449844458947
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over	3.3739424228447947
at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr	4.684564610734275
darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband	1.19433008046321
he bore it however with admirable calmness	1.4635683444239667
he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st	3.2258858231754326
james s with very decent composure	1.009256424194423
if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight	1.7123127464959687
philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar	2.37893730984985
nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant	2.3619207531209607
elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley	3.291283395070474
chapter xix	1
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs	2.662757356771263
bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters	1.7796329961116177
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs	2.3991589911903053
bingley and talked of mrs	1
darcy may be guessed	1
he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected	1.3055117989397733
bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth	2.0661946153975244
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart	2.489003977045503
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other	2.106573979472104
kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters	1.6715943770654675
in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great	1.635501957747325
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid	2.1378805979267645
from the farther disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs	2.8407538468683002
wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going	2.5131479000830637
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs	2.334116251666174
bennet s being quite unable to sit alone	1.3535162716076055
mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance	2.486784466699373
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune	2.874183395678669
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished	2.7156678721331775
the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy	5.056078621658135
if you love mr	1
it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us	4.349028534438835
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help	2.6783831393405486
any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr	2.0595432002569165
darcy about it if you had rather not	3.5602466019923593
yours c	1
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	2.5480622297371176
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills	2.3407009790743274
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought	1.5310049051672958
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference her s lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her	2.104186986573512
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth s sake he assisted him farther in his profession	2.290774590232745
lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone	2.2136191015779643
pemberley was now georgiana s home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see	2.4122117040631177
he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry	1.9284451854056355
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way	1.4835996141247096
by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	3.5687971329196406
but at length by elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	2.7040294923658625
darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them	2.7333876847537204
transcriber s note spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book	1.9209094533691087
