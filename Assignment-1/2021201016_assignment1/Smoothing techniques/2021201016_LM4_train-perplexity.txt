a yellow dressinggown ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air	pp=1.501072194374157
he held the bowl aloft and intoned  _introibo ad altare dei_	pp=1.406994383388357
halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely  come up kinch come up you fearful jesuit  solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest	pp=1.5236873653231602
he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains	pp=1.4289454362478384
then catching sight of stephen dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head	pp=1.7473453567000683

but hising up her petticoats_  he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned	pp=1.4013002962688206

and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain	pp=1.5368639342408446
his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief	pp=1.399837890860544

stephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it	pp=1.8134257316382512
he put the huge key in his inner pocket	pp=1.4882327450138702
at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked  did you bring the key	pp=1.5505926137604713

at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island	pp=1.4115357238978992

the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would according to the best approved tradition of medical science be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis_  so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this that and the other	pp=1.6937386447407192

but who was gerty	pp=1.1848205242558487
gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions lost in thought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see	pp=1.4703835249452888
she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said she was more a giltrap than a macdowell	pp=1.5173486753989276
her figure was slight and graceful inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welchs female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling	pp=1.6397774051586949
the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine cupids bow greekly perfect	pp=1.459334721514263
her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either	pp=1.6522647185999353
bertha supple told that once to edy boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or shed never speak to her again no	pp=1.8539192331893573
honour where honour is due	pp=1.119679376502425
there was an innate refinement a languid queenly _hauteur_ about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep	pp=1.4114053971856155
had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her	pp=1.6598602789895696
mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaning that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charm few could resist	pp=1.5701875832656775
why have women such eyes of witchery	pp=1.2354123140606856
gertys were of the bluest irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows	pp=1.4022233013332746

it was dark brown with a natural wave in it	pp=1.447459639932835
she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too thursday for wealth	pp=1.7105613124418015
and just now at edys words as a telltale flush delicate as the faintest rosebloom crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety gods fair land of ireland did not hold her equal	pp=1.506833090645654
for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes	pp=1.5806205568964034

they were protestants in his family and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then saint joseph	pp=1.7271028489144833
but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didnt go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden	pp=2.0797350927639062
gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out	pp=1.7577643808607664
a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes because it was expected in the _ladys pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection	pp=1.5610274269207565
she wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone	pp=1.55562220829472
all tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at clerys summer sales the very it slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny	pp=1.470226358204271
she did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew	pp=1.9127218556890377
her shoes were the newest thing in footwear edy boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell a five and never would ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep	pp=1.5452781896526606
her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops	pp=1.4901519983159974
as for undies they were gertys chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though gerty would never see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her	pp=1.6019635159821508
she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery three garments and nighties extra and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons rosepink pale blue mauve and peagreen and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldnt trust those washerwomen as far as shed see them scorching the things	pp=1.5651112745225053
she was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasnt of a friday	pp=1.8963163660958753
her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where giving way to tears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror	pp=1.9945544876488743
you are lovely gerty it said	pp=1.1529137935321994
the paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful	pp=1.361496680483309
gerty macdowell yearns in vain	pp=1.1034150876435034
yes she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy wylie t c d	pp=1.4782203806139298
because the one who married the elder brother would be mrs wylie and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be	pp=1.5799102386424808
he was too young to understand	pp=1.5428949453004213
he would not believe in love a womans birthright	pp=1.721872615099756
the night of the party long ago in stoers he was still in short trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips	pp=1.8381833473381857
he called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss the first but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments	pp=2.0404847183449095
impetuous fellow strength of character had never been reggy wylies strong point and he who would woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men	pp=1.6330997294256882
but waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over	pp=1.8331206036388543
no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey and who would understand take her in his sheltering arms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss	pp=1.7411946839459167
it would be like heaven	pp=1.997995893021273
for such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve	pp=1.2980002204068974
with all the heart of her she longs to be his only his affianced bride for riches for poor in sickness in health till death us two part from this to this day forward	pp=1.6453341082098076
and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be	pp=1.7007685556756271
then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face bertha supple too and edy little spitfire because she would be twentytwo in november	pp=1.6812157777340866
she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess	pp=1.5173728529724864
her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen anns pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didnt like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldnt eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa giltraps lovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in clerys summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses	pp=1.5600398028881717
he would be tall with broad shoulders she had always admired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon three wonderful weeks and then when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning they would both have brekky simple but perfectly served for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes	pp=1.6264170269813896
edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight	pp=1.8498614871613166
but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it thered be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if you please	pp=2.0140434602909134
the temper of him o he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of pinnies	pp=1.9736452406270681
edy told him no no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him	pp=2.062865694429298
youre not my sister naughty tommy said	pp=1.2225077566011109
its my ball	pp=1.259520839032383
but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career having won the day	pp=1.6630139984342451
anything for a quiet life laughed ciss	pp=1.3017480505699528
and she tickled tiny tots two cheeks to make him forget and played heres the lord mayor heres his two horses heres his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin	pp=1.584885879338029
but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him	pp=1.5178997676587112
id like to give him something she said so i would where i wont say	pp=2.071387659817832
on the beeoteetom laughed cissy merrily	pp=1.1232467428068222
gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud shed be ashamed of her life to say flushing a deep rosy red and edy boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said	pp=1.7670168161651234
but not a pin cared ciss	pp=1.2918722181830409
let him she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose	pp=1.7252659754382427
give it to him too on the same place as quick as id look at him	pp=2.130155350389928
madcap ciss with her golliwog curls	pp=1.2008550536071423
you had to laugh at her sometimes	pp=1.6966296825359561
for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the mens faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white	pp=1.7391092111921138
that was just like cissycums	pp=1.468864659402122
o and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her fathers suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down tritonville road smoking a cigarette	pp=1.6158267477177108
there was none to come up to her for fun	pp=1.622383609956595
but she was sincerity itself one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of your twofaced things too sweet to be wholesome	pp=1.7341182358821077
and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ	pp=1.7746385714403627
it was the mens temperance retreat conducted by the missioner the reverend john hughes s j	pp=1.513424915374497
rosary sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament	pp=1.6768623535710916
they were there gathered together without distinction of social class and a most edifying spectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the waves after the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet of the immaculate reciting the litany of our lady of loreto beseeching her to intercede for them the old familiar words holy mary holy virgin of virgins	pp=1.5572501724908536
how sad to poor gertys ears had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in pearsons weekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none	pp=1.4012044566099995
over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket thinking	pp=1.7224607332788935
but that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days	pp=1.3211564612902627
nay she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father a prey to the fumes of intoxication forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low	pp=1.9005081089790608
and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful virgin most merciful	pp=1.372482138022749
and gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk	pp=1.6377437324355093
you never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face it was a palpable case of doctor fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose	pp=2.0608377245842133
poor father with all his faults she loved him still when he sang _tell me mary how to woo thee_ or _my love and cottage near rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenbys salad dressing for supper and when he sang _the moon hath raised_ with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried god have mercy on him from a stroke	pp=1.585826550603378
her mothers birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken	pp=1.5259101951528482
noone would have thought the end was so near	pp=1.5272424574378038
now he was laid to rest	pp=1.2711851348573713
a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold	pp=1.808597351873781
and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she didnt like her mothers taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about taking snuff	pp=1.6591761378632843
everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways	pp=1.603345673057343
it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime mr tunney the grocers christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window	pp=1.7520280743658894
you could see there was a story behind it	pp=1.9189585413467596
the colours were done something lovely	pp=1.153625431092777
she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat	pp=1.7896914751932973
she often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in walkers pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant	pp=1.6540538293310565
needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball	pp=1.538733112400373
our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please	pp=1.640137011334112
the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gertys skirt near the little pool by the rock	pp=1.5288640142207768
the twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadnt come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed	pp=1.7561431874803606
if you fail try again edy boardman said	pp=1.2410835753584515
gerty smiled assent and bit her lip	pp=1.1518417477626375
a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle	pp=1.696417912143913
pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking	pp=2.0723586079464393
she felt the warm flush a danger signal always with gerty macdowell surging and flaming into her cheeks	pp=1.3769333573970137
till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen	pp=1.8044685791491857
through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray for us vessel of singular devotion pray for us mystical rose	pp=1.8394415243199427
and careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary the most pious virgins intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her	pp=1.6191893823229844
cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air	pp=1.335222919420528
peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah and my word didnt the little chap enjoy that and then she told him to say papa	pp=1.8247019764645827
say papa baby	pp=1.2330802270396364
say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa	pp=1.1333465558231905
and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health a perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to be something great they said	pp=1.8567960041402856
cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out holy saint denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him	pp=1.7105769423028314
of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it  habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa	pp=1.4048510213781662
and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks	pp=1.2815935057249672
it was all no use soothering him with no nono baby no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss always readywitted gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased	pp=1.707852150502373
she gazed out towards the distant sea	pp=1.5151002706665713
it was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft	pp=2.0585127670265484
and while she gazed her heart went pitapat	pp=1.3070659726172698
yes it was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his look	pp=2.369840407171105
his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through read her very soul	pp=1.433618545919048
people were so queer	pp=1.1610197467737893
she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo she had of martin harvey the matinee idol only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasnt stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting	pp=1.8876563090838694
he was in deep mourning she could see that and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face	pp=2.2297123796414304
she would have given worlds to know what it was	pp=1.9415426300096197
he was looking up so intently so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down	pp=1.877455214493132
she was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was far away	pp=1.751122090579724
here was that of which she had so often dreamed	pp=1.932535628722283
it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like noone else	pp=2.072382504473073
the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him her dreamhusband because she knew on the instant it was him	pp=1.8321576627625014
if he had suffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had been himself a sinner a wicked man she cared not	pp=1.83295168217148
even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her	pp=1.8882619336932585
there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm	pp=1.204996137755449
she was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known those cyclists showing off what they hadnt got and she just yearned to know all to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forget the memory of the past	pp=1.7110887383643179
then mayhap he would embrace her gently like a real man crushing her soft body to him and love her his ownest girlie for herself alone	pp=1.6152639789495158
refuge of sinners	pp=1.2598351557267493
comfortress of the afflicted	pp=1.1890703055562681
_ora pro nobis_	pp=1.1052064057018762
well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart	pp=1.547634770368179
gerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glass windows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgins sodality and father conroy was helping canon ohanlon at the altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down	pp=1.765509280747558
he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of saint dominic	pp=1.6283813445957134
he told her that time when she told him about that in confession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to natures laws he said in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god he said and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word	pp=2.1792151047863526
he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place	pp=1.8794455757368465
the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it	pp=1.6296598885953297
little monkeys common as ditchwater	pp=1.1601141119366754
someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both of them	pp=1.832317743200625
jacky tommy  not they what a great notion they had so cissy said it was the very last time shed ever bring them out	pp=1.909456300214498
she jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldnt get it to grow long because it wasnt natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it	pp=1.7663784438317924
she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didnt rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible	pp=2.315933626147675
it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble	pp=1.7294305362399822
_tableau_ that would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness	pp=2.1043777667663837
queen of angels queen of patriarchs queen of prophets of all saints they prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed the thurible to canon ohanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didnt because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon ohanlon handed the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the _tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _tantumer gosa cramen tum_	pp=1.8836787446022651
three and eleven she paid for those stockings in sparrows of georges street on the tuesday no the monday before easter and there wasnt a brack on them and that was what he was looking at transparent and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form the cheek of her because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself	pp=1.8446302463210222
cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature	pp=1.8407273411834737
gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girls shouldersa radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening in its sweetness	pp=1.6026089498943021
she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve	pp=1.6619571233096857
she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes	pp=1.6947410904888995
he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey	pp=1.412757319223232
her womans instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose	pp=1.8305981955886608
edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty half smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse the baby	pp=1.600313347824949
irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why noone could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers	pp=1.8021943051386407
and she said to gerty  a penny for your thoughts what	pp=1.7361674308805815
replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth	pp=1.4613491236164666
because she wished to goodness theyd take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late	pp=1.77762472677916
and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy as glib as you like said it was half past kissing time time to kiss again	pp=1.6939945516646184
but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early	pp=2.029862976799221
wait said cissy ill run ask my uncle peter over there whats the time by his conundrum	pp=1.4484391804860413
so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with his watchchain looking up at the church	pp=2.0235135757976863
passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself	pp=2.126527734521571
one moment he had been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure	pp=1.7375553015929253
cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set	pp=2.087386085746658
his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones	pp=1.7663977251946597
cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order	pp=1.5936393456322244
it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets	pp=2.629983573495262
she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon	pp=1.9743663626851762
his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour literally worshipping at her shrine	pp=1.4623136796390186
if ever there was undisguised admiration in a mans passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that mans face	pp=1.7510680048639442
it is for you gertrude macdowell and you know it	pp=1.6272313480961893
edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon ohanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over	pp=1.9431105050300375
gerty winced sharply	pp=1.1006363640762042
a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable	pp=1.428494904069634
it hurto yes it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was	pp=1.5039107367485622
gertys lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat so slim so flawless so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of	pp=1.3959776404476059
she had loved him better than he knew	pp=1.520159897448293
lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears	pp=2.1335165852806828
i can throw my cap at who i like because its leap year	pp=1.3291980072180059
there was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with	pp=2.0397118046574576
as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces	pp=1.8574832648427837
and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot	pp=1.7477169396135397
miss puny little edys countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it the little kinnatt because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof apart in another sphere that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it	pp=1.7675686285918906
edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for master boardman junior	pp=1.8179481300865339
and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleeful eyes and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib	pp=1.731957224800914
o my puddeny pie protested ciss	pp=1.0918649838258396
he has his bib destroyed	pp=1.3461278015975588
the slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights	pp=1.400057153367281
gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because canon ohanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands	pp=1.8743148801598568
how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse of erin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk hither thither with a tiny lost cry	pp=1.6863623704718322
and she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _the lamplighter_ by miss cummins author of _mabel vaughan_ and other tales	pp=1.6818211448979201
for gerty had her dreams that noone knew of	pp=1.3009266827689265
she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which though it did not err on the side of luxury was scrupulously neat and clean	pp=1.6754907591596688
it was there she kept her girlish treasure trove the tortoiseshell combs her child of mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in helys of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs	pp=1.6313407266910709
_art thou real my ideal_ it was called by louis j walsh magherafelt and after there was something about _twilight wilt thou ever_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry so sad in its transient loveliness had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her one by one and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it	pp=1.6052747004152101
but it must end she felt	pp=1.2602558122822243
if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her	pp=1.7164087327382855
love laughs at locksmiths	pp=1.0745078217380202
she would make the great sacrifice	pp=1.3678778589877567
her every effort would be to share his thoughts	pp=1.3219816192134224
dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness	pp=1.7883623050811444
there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse cruel only to be kind	pp=1.928807517889613
would it make a very great difference	pp=1.5875972844072836
from everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled	pp=1.5380544115501458
she loathed that sort of person the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girls honour degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station	pp=1.6704818164694555
no no not that	pp=1.1596795350176354
they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess	pp=1.6317027040948975
perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall	pp=2.0899871790403854
she thought she understood	pp=1.3446297833555672
she would try to understand him because men were so different	pp=1.3713723720433963
the old love was waiting waiting with little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes	pp=1.4351767479813635
heart of mine she would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide	pp=2.1424124021683673
nothing else mattered	pp=1.5645383204036616
come what might she would be wild untrammelled free	pp=1.4328137526802829
canon ohanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _laudate dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked wasnt she coming but jacky caffrey called out  o look cissy  and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church blue and then green and purple	pp=1.734142033081551
its fireworks cissy caffrey said	pp=1.1780329718043991
its the bazaar fireworks	pp=1.1390821636333757
but gerty was adamant	pp=1.1441989553549556
she had no intention of being at their beck and call	pp=1.4702999847893528
if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was	pp=1.731159389741803
the eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling	pp=1.4974547345988478
she looked at him a moment meeting his glance and a light broke in upon her	pp=1.4881011912948676
whitehot passion was in that face passion silent as the grave and it had made her his	pp=1.7887524756268207
at last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death steadfast a sterling man a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips	pp=1.665389099334645
his hands and face were working and a tremour went over her	pp=1.4097378049430527
she leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was noone to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that supply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passion of men like that hotblooded because bertha supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear shed never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the congested districts board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed	pp=1.7791091203897211
but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips	pp=1.8382618371298978
besides there was absolution so long as you didnt do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too my dear and winny rippingham so mad about actors photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did	pp=1.8857643721100878
and jacky caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air a soft thing to and fro dark	pp=2.2093088265341114
and she saw a long roman candle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hush they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it high high almost out of sight and her face was suffused with a divine an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too nainsook knickers the fabric that caresses the skin better than those other pettiwidth the green four and eleven on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where noone ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasnt ashamed and he wasnt either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldnt resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking looking	pp=1.8405906297986405
she would fain have cried to him chokingly held out her snowy slender arms to him to come to feel his lips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girls love a little strangled cry wrung from her that cry that has rung through the ages	pp=1.620776073336054
and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o and everyone cried o o in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden o so lovely o soft sweet soft  then all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent	pp=1.6488275474840026
ah she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly a pathetic little glance of piteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl	pp=1.497213919514432
he was leaning back against the rock behind	pp=1.3481625181511971

a fair unsullied soul had called to him and wretch that he was how had he answered	pp=1.9110340972494102
an utter cad he had been he of all men but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered	pp=1.870907677280463
should a girl tell	pp=1.1790777237075225
no a thousand times no	pp=1.1944399338409866
that was their secret only theirs alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats dont tell	pp=1.7557222096767808
cissy caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was and then she cried  gerty gerty were going come on	pp=1.602739779631148
we can see from farther up	pp=1.3345135081440858
gerty had an idea one of loves little ruses	pp=1.375293336155271

she drew herself up to her full height	pp=1.5961198164927892
their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of a strange shining hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face	pp=1.6176861205990056
she half smiled at him wanly a sweet forgiving smile a smile that verged on tears and then they parted	pp=1.4262776776394797
slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey to little baby boardman	pp=1.550755041099997
it was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed	pp=1.6163695032098262
she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly becausebecause gerty macdowell was tight boots no	pp=1.6072658136820877

the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed	pp=1.774155746484125
the nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be	pp=1.7615255350040768
she said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that womans birth	pp=1.60201606017275
then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house	pp=1.8830742410351815
the man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder womens woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid	pp=1.7456647041054298
nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless	pp=1.1102851788946382
and whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat	pp=1.672479092698389
and there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon	pp=1.521493778480814
and the traveller leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice	pp=1.7391863128544243
and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there	pp=1.8219910936010046
and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile	pp=2.224233688354722
also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility	pp=1.4402086435496657
but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle	pp=1.7962137326236916
and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery	pp=1.6283110239526233
and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment	pp=1.7710741416762867
and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously	pp=1.4904651443927037
and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles	pp=1.6024738610868698
and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer	pp=1.522828646986696
and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so	pp=1.570352951033418
and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress	pp=1.4582009771220585
and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain	pp=1.6662851208674279
and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each	pp=1.3847043299395485
and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile	pp=1.5127488726005887
and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile	pp=1.9866341612710288
thanked be almighty god	pp=1.0555133997030488
this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time hied fast	pp=1.6438105507300151
sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel said he that it be not come or now	pp=1.673911274731699
meseems it dureth overlong	pp=1.0339449333851454
and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently	pp=1.9618748062257174
but said he or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long	pp=1.4671671290096688
and the franklin that had drunken said expecting each moment to be her next	pp=1.4072312657876975
also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and now drink said he fully delectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their boths health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness	pp=1.841569667892306
and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup	pp=1.9346328455130093
now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might	pp=1.513758230122664
there was a sort of scholars along either side the board that is to wit dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciables with other his fellows lynch and madden scholars of medicine and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa one crotthers and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested and of all them reserved young stephen he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sir leopold	pp=1.7007013245138165
but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow	pp=1.588587482447605
and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner	pp=1.673402401660465
ruth red him love led on with will to wander loth to leave	pp=1.3463318839096947
and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in hornes house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case	pp=1.6240465089299623
and they said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die	pp=1.6310913164080862
and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy	pp=1.5308640313593271
a redress god grant	pp=1.0739179924661215
this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay by our virgin mother the wife should live and the babe to die	pp=1.4586758637480273
in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack	pp=1.4548959237616952
then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved	pp=1.6104434508435286
to whom young stephen had these words following murmur sirs is eke oft among lay folk	pp=1.3102450509323202

we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we	pp=1.3383278493587576
then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends	pp=1.2840223619622593
but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead	pp=1.7603817024596506
whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachis praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do	pp=1.5633726310205702
thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever	pp=1.744869766542953
then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom of law of canons of lilith patron of abortions of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or as virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with _effectu secuto_ or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides	pp=1.5559815046271976
he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for gods greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fishermans seal even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded	pp=1.5393260811832927
all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life	pp=1.411242593607042
a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he said dissembling as his wont was that as it was informed him who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions	pp=1.582591802130433
that is truth pardy said dixon and or i err a pregnant word	pp=1.280930003070468
which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons	pp=1.9245884775593844
but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny	pp=1.5430239990732078
and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lambs wool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friends son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all accounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores	pp=1.6913962508501015
about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray	pp=1.4909766217508689

but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin	pp=1.9298032618987715
thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses as the priests use in madagascar island she to be in guise of white and saffron her groom in white and grain with burning of nard and tapers on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided	pp=1.498846445910798

and he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm	pp=1.5576927254005835
then did some mock and some jeer and punch costello fell hard again to his yale which master lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour	pp=1.6238973295147532
but the braggart boaster cried that an old nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead	pp=1.6477614183590994
but this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in hornes hall	pp=1.391810249150908
he drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden being godly certain whiles knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom at the braggarts side spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead look you having taken place and all of the order of a natural phenomenon	pp=1.6408785154700773
but was young boasthards fear vanquished by calmers words	pp=1.1868597538782337
no for he had in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be done away	pp=1.691040770462335
and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other	pp=1.5574117508746035
he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either	pp=2.002270134586271
but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal	pp=1.5377151846718322
indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle	pp=1.4501467486136936
heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or what calmer said a hubbub of phenomenon heard	pp=1.6267456360679706
why he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding which he had not done	pp=1.9668904393299784
for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show	pp=2.541135854584188
and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away	pp=1.646522298234632
by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law	pp=1.5879110130593272
then wotted he nought of that other land which is called believeonme that is the land of promise which behoves to the king delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it	pp=1.7021945548042838
yes pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name she said is birdinthehand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as ho you pretty man turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named twointhebush or by some learned carnal concupiscence	pp=1.8692377710182624
this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore birdinthehand which was within all foul plagues monsters and a wicked devil they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her	pp=1.5133649549769619
for regarding believeonme they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for first twointhebush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them pickaback and topsyturvy and shameface and cheek by jowl and second for that foul plague allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and third that they might take no hurt neither from offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named killchild	pp=1.5399787526208535

with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that nights gazette and he made a show to find it about him for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it but on stephens persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk	pp=1.9401349077827876
he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat	pp=1.7531594263556118
to tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps ostlers bookies pauls men runners flatcaps waistcoateers ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip	pp=1.4757581153919013
he took his ordinary at a boilingcooks and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mothers son of them would burst their sides	pp=1.6664681783341468

_mort aux vaches_ says frank then in the french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too	pp=1.5655817416346878
from a child this frank had been a donought that his father a headborough who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes	pp=1.658334442486467
one time he would be a playactor then a sutler or a welsher then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk kidnapping a squires heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids linen or choking chicken behind a hedge	pp=1.6715405681256275

more like tis the hoose or the timber tongue	pp=1.2740506085631949
mr stephen a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperors chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality that was sending over doctor rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns	pp=1.6928399159533227
come come says mr vincent plain dealing	pp=1.4903858923517657
hell find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull thats irish says he	pp=1.470274349232336
irish by name and irish by nature says mr stephen and he sent the ale purling about an irish bull in an english chinashop	pp=1.515407284139862
i conceive you says mr dixon	pp=1.3618415706466014
it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emerald ring in his nose	pp=1.6478547278895697
true for you says mr vincent cross the table and a bullseye into the bargain says he and a plumper and a portlier bull says he never shit on shamrock	pp=1.854789068489975
he had horns galore a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpins followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains	pp=1.7841235323258209
what for that says mr dixon but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself	pp=1.7293982676503228
so be off now says he and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmers blessing and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly	pp=1.7419039181428628
another then put in his word and they dressed him says he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his hearts content	pp=1.674193678080095
by this time the father of the faithful for so they called him was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture	pp=1.756227269673445
to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls language and they all after him	pp=1.6172394014880958
ay says another and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice saying by the lord harry green is the grass that grows on the ground	pp=2.0457686607613565
and says mr dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out hed run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harrys orders	pp=1.6308112808407444
there was bad blood between them at first says mr vincent and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and ill meddle in his matters says he	pp=1.7734818744431187
ill make that animal smell hell says he with the help of that good pizzle my father left me	pp=1.4520986613935682
but one evening says mr dixon when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the romans _bos bovum_ which is good bog latin for boss of the show	pp=1.7277324430059426
after that says mr vincent the lord harry put his head into a cows drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name	pp=1.9184655196986669
then with the water running off him he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat	pp=1.7570989159521526
in short he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt	pp=1.5130649219424575
they were says mr stephen and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as the ungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect manned the yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the wind put her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ran up the jolly roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america	pp=1.557006334148144
which was the occasion says mr vincent of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty  _pope peters but a pissabed	pp=1.5576364249634937
a mans a man for a that_  our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered a young gentleman his name alec bannon who had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars	pp=1.5812784599044436
mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on	pp=1.837132867141185
whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnells bearing a legend printed in fair italics _mr malachi mulligan	pp=1.6554960445563145
fertiliser and incubator lambay island_	pp=1.0706134755433931
his project as he went on to expound was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed	pp=1.5695192543728331
well let us hear of it good my friend said mr dixon	pp=1.5092515644374649
i make no doubt it smacks of wenching	pp=1.26533040729932
come be seated both	pp=1.1214734887807232
tis as cheap sitting as standing	pp=1.1514118681485122
mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and expatiating upon his design told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility both the inhibitory and the prohibitory whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired	pp=1.574186125930673
it grieved him plaguily he said to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to the vilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weep	pp=1.5211470047062399
to curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder lord talbot de malahide a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party	pp=1.41763620892506
he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural	pp=1.5035636825929553
money was no object he said nor would he take a penny for his pains	pp=1.6968678262808166
the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions would find in him their man	pp=1.4896375153891908
for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies	pp=1.4188433493294712
after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it	pp=1.76408424407661
they both it seems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water as might be observed by mr mulligans smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald	pp=1.5311426432489035
his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of marys excepted to it asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle	pp=1.4079297869527285
mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which as it dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention _talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi o quirites ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt_ while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach the buck and doe of the forest glade the farmyard drake and duck	pp=1.3968006385845935
valuing himself not a little upon his elegance being indeed a proper man of person this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced	pp=1.4854864599880053
the young gentleman his friend overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour	pp=1.7940294537394523
mr mulligan now perceiving the table asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and seeing the stranger he made him a civil bow and said pray sir was you in need of any professional assistance we could give	pp=1.5153741184877891
who upon his offer thanked him very heartily though preserving his proper distance and replied that he was come there about a lady now an inmate of hornes house that was in an interesting condition poor body from womans woe and here he fetched a deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet taken place	pp=1.6977941918678217
mr dixon to turn the table took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence upon which he rallied him betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due as with the noted physician mr austin meldon to a wolf in the stomach	pp=1.425716338937044
for answer mr mulligan in a gale of laughter at his smalls smote himself bravely below the diaphragm exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan the most excellent creature of her sex though tis pity shes a trollop theres a belly that never bore a bastard	pp=1.477253394969154
this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight	pp=1.3984259375328658
the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber	pp=1.67772383768873
here the listener who was none other than the scotch student a little fume of a fellow blond as tow congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and interrupting the narrative at a salient point having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it	pp=1.638401343807925
_mais bien sûr_ noble stranger said he cheerily _et mille compliments_	pp=1.2177189220997278

there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity	pp=1.3438987786302397

with these words he approached the goblet to his lips took a complacent draught of the cordial slicked his hair and opening his bosom out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein	pp=1.5836713588826323
gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness ah monsieur he said had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily in such an artless disorder of so melting a tenderness pon my conscience even you monsieur had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever	pp=1.539105502275767

a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and having replaced the locket in his bosom he wiped his eye and sighed again	pp=1.559261594922996

my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for as she reminded me blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies dame nature by the divine blessing has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties is the fittest nay the only garment	pp=1.5578742182789946

do you remember her vincent	pp=1.575879724077989
i wish you could have seen my queen today vincent said	pp=1.4604954485169097
how young she was and radiant lalage were scarce fair beside her in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin i do not know the right name of it	pp=1.7194712861827028
the chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us	pp=1.3687836731521021
in the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with corinth fruit in them that periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge	pp=1.504870185631166

do you not think it stephen	pp=1.4054503947315076
theosophos told me so stephen answered whom in a previous existence egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law	pp=1.4140211410127903
the lords of the moon theosophos told me an orangefiery shipload from planet alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation	pp=1.4618752672519706
during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled by messrs bass and co at burtonontrent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyones remark on account of its scarlet appearance	pp=1.8920536451325596
he was simply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings after the moment befores observations about boyhood days and the turf recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn	pp=1.5861569487019873
eventually however both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same time however a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place	pp=1.8563851228673012
the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life	pp=1.5321893162850506
neither place nor council was lacking in dignity	pp=1.1779227338794127
the debaters were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital	pp=1.557460057269023
the high hall of hornes house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic	pp=1.4565005517422287
a gallant scene in truth it made	pp=1.2051240890465846
crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of galloway	pp=1.7488764544232203
there too opposite to him was lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom	pp=1.3059504281936678
next the scotchman was the place assigned to costello the eccentric while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of madden	pp=1.4999805855461221
lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator fresh from the hippodrome and that vigilant wanderer soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come	pp=1.4692191420945795
it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which mr s dedalus div scep	pp=1.6190303674311441
contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods	pp=1.288966178712461
science it cannot be too often repeated deals with tangible phenomena	pp=1.2696855547902712
the man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can	pp=1.628074217296288
there may be it is true some questions which science cannot answerat presentsuch as the first problem submitted by mr l bloom pubb canv	pp=1.4308247853695353
regarding the future determination of sex	pp=1.1846532030149532
must we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary the postmenstrual period assert others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it as most embryologists incline to opine such as culpepper spallanzani blumenbach lusk hertwig leopold and valenti a mixture of both	pp=1.4602786778008394
this would be tantamount to a cooperation one of natures favourite devices between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position _succubitus felix_ of the passive element	pp=1.681410850773811
the other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital infant mortality	pp=1.3625103089832336
it is interesting because as he pertinently remarks we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways mr m mulligan hyg et eug doc	pp=1.7651473355475857
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust	pp=1.1727170925312749
these factors he alleged and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets hideous publicity posters religious ministers of all denominations mutilated soldiers and sailors exposed scorbutic cardrivers the suspended carcases of dead animals paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennasthese he said were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race	pp=1.367613574968982
kalipedia he prophesied would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life genuinely good music agreeable literature light philosophy instructive pictures plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as venus and apollo artistic coloured photographs of prize babies all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner mr j crotthers disc bacc	pp=1.5279014187780573
attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect private or official culminating in the exposure of newborn infants the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide	pp=1.5020741325580749
although the former we are thinking of neglect is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative	pp=1.425013345862046
an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr v lynch bacc arith	pp=1.3469314179235823
that both natality and mortality as well as all other phenomena of evolution tidal movements lunar phases blood temperatures diseases in general everything in fine in natures vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained	pp=1.5738043689015684
still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood though other children of the same marriage do not must certainly in the poets words give us pause	pp=1.540706388522523
remark or should it be called an interruption	pp=1.279347088337605
that an omnivorous being which can masticate deglute digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition corpulent professional gentlemen not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to	pp=1.4504057877038223
for the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother	pp=1.4353322786175728

in his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot	pp=1.5264478073940575
a white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket_      iii     <NUM>   preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed	pp=1.6140168208382524
his stephens mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting off the reel the propriety of the cabmans shelter as it was called hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral	pp=1.6940802202850624
but how to get there was the rub	pp=1.9429573422603952
for the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned	pp=1.580104304098321
so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition both of them being eded particularly stephen always assuming that there was such a thing to be found	pp=1.9655067987814976
accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they both walked together along beaver street or more properly lane as far as the farriers and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergins	pp=1.7099411575656986
but as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree outside the north star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom who was anything but a professional whistler endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twice	pp=1.7932096916757445
this was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on it evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did	pp=1.6512031130374185
so bevelling around by mulletts and the signal house which they shortly reached they proceeded perforce in the direction of amiens street railway terminus mr bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to vary the timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing he heroically made light of the mischance	pp=1.7685370266789735
so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as it happened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey	pp=1.4518739535451348
as it so happened a dublin united tramways companys sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back	pp=1.615257983950655
they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station the starting point for belfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality not to say gruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street famous for its c division police station	pp=1.5618596067597241
between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen associated with bairds the stonecutters in his mind somehow in talbot place first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his _fidus achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourkes city bakery situated quite close to where they were the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable	pp=1.6867255947224549
bread the staff of life earn your bread o tell me where is fancy bread at rourkes the bakers it is said	pp=1.4123127551351575
_en route_ to his taciturn and not to put too fine a point on it not yet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties never more so in fact disgustingly sober spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swell mobsmen which barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didnt look out	pp=1.6581404547586134
highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr tobias or he being the solicitor rather old wall he meant to say or mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about	pp=1.8811718113548959
the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordially disliked were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and as mr bloom put it recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot	pp=1.689676851883136
never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes	pp=1.8506277124939514
another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything	pp=1.401675416277117
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question of stimulants he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically	pp=1.6174362022191262
and that one was judas stephen said who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind	pp=1.5957498160348587
discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps	pp=1.732645203588711
stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox	pp=1.9323567273051636
he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his fathers gumley	pp=1.6768833298585717
to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge	pp=1.546056020034495
someone saluted you mr bloom said	pp=1.1685195219500477
a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again calling  night  stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment	pp=1.4491144845402992
mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least	pp=1.4346146510194353
though unusual in the dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper famished loiterers of the thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments notice your money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged and garrotted	pp=1.586789455535009
lord john corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise	pp=1.5652167638930998
he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division lately deceased who had married a certain katherine brophy the daughter of a louth farmer	pp=1.6338460128295735
his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine also talbot	pp=1.4620802731403117
rumour had it though not proved that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative a woman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen	pp=1.5761050384774988
this therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as lord john corley	pp=1.4399431219377576
taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell	pp=1.6458546114781814
not as much as a farthing to purchase a nights lodgings	pp=1.6186025648802334
his friends had all deserted him	pp=1.1741185280416881
furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions	pp=1.9005244770151026
he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on gods earth he could get something anything at all to do	pp=1.8632936042757826
no it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasnt a complete fabrication from start to finish	pp=1.9518227823506613
anyhow he was all in	pp=1.7060953177453353
i wouldnt ask you only pursued he on my solemn oath and god knows im on the rocks	pp=1.4132422672895943
therell be a job tomorrow or next day stephen told him in a boys school at dalkey for a gentleman usher	pp=1.6026739399090264

you may mention my name	pp=1.1173850461076327

i have no place to sleep myself stephen informed him	pp=1.4879495842038846
corley at the first gooff was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street	pp=1.790728599061801
there was a dosshouse in marlborough street mrs maloneys but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but mconachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in winetavern street which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon for a bob	pp=1.7141369351645264
he was starving too though he hadnt said a word about it	pp=1.5120017920703053
though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephens feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corleys brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence	pp=1.6920393323347924
however _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished	pp=1.7668517447613346
but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corleys head that he was living in affluence and hadnt a thing to do but hand out the needful whereas	pp=1.9394457451548501
he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for to his chagrin he found his cash missing	pp=1.896641421206282
a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation	pp=1.5884456597876893
he tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact	pp=1.8887471600651309
he was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect	pp=1.4176359012068187
about biscuits he dimly remembered	pp=1.0878709894719045
who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy	pp=1.414760426762198
however in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies erroneously however as it turned out	pp=1.5981022616384213
those are halfcrowns man corley corrected him	pp=1.12354452818234
and so in point of fact they turned out to be	pp=1.5179128581753119
stephen anyhow lent him one of them	pp=1.333727715392898
thanks corley answered youre a gentleman	pp=1.2174808697729769
whos that with you	pp=1.1353586901159565
i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan the billsticker	pp=1.9425907958364412
you might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there	pp=1.9411806624095096
god youve to book ahead man youd think it was for the carl rosa	pp=1.5497477344180455
i dont give a shite anyway so long as i get a job even as a crossing sweeper	pp=1.797436229510438
subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky that he said stephen knew well out of fullams the shipchandlers bookkeeper there that used to be often round in nagles back with omara and a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe	pp=1.8381089246543736
anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable	pp=1.6393977065673577
mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchmans sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work it struck him was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while dublin slept	pp=1.7584967767239068
he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephens anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when	pp=1.9376655810506773
being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity	pp=1.474524076822971
palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to put it a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether	pp=2.040159237116462
in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning	pp=2.0161429695180884
pretty thick that was certainly	pp=1.2116836754501206
the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who with his practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite	pp=1.8498704891539752
alluding to the encounter he said laughingly stephen that is  he is down on his luck	pp=1.5270291482005718
at this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest mr bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair whereupon he observed evasively  everybody gets their own ration of luck they say	pp=1.603803401898934
now you mention it his face was familiar to me	pp=1.4381649184324798
but leaving that for the moment how much did you part with he queried if i am not too inquisitive	pp=1.9584567977753276
half a crown stephen responded	pp=1.2840722576115942
i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere	pp=1.3249991684923104
needs mr bloom ejaculated professing not the least surprise at the intelligence i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he invariably does	pp=1.5510071865161654
everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds	pp=1.479088942414808
walking to sandycove is out of the question	pp=2.0341088161864396
and even supposing you did you wont get in after what occurred at westland row station	pp=1.59779575520639
simply fag out there for nothing	pp=1.296846245884666
i dont mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your fathers house	pp=1.7231261998302856
to seek misfortune was stephens answer	pp=1.1725910440803053
i met your respected father on a recent occasion mr bloom diplomatically returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate on yesterday	pp=1.39059051026922
where does he live at present	pp=1.3500197648985797
i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved	pp=2.116405814558687
i believe he is in dublin somewhere stephen answered unconcernedly why	pp=1.5062740264740213
a gifted man mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one	pp=1.6817818403638973
he takes great pride quite legitimate out of you	pp=1.241773597307818
you could go back perhaps he hasarded still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two mulligan that is and that english tourist friend of his who eventually euchred their third companion were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion which they did	pp=1.716010347618066
there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however such as it was stephens minds eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by the ingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy boody and katey the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it being quarter tense or if not ember days or something like that	pp=1.7437733455818238
no mr bloom repeated again i wouldnt personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element dr mulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes	pp=1.5390455105603302
he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals	pp=1.5539184544790425
of course you didnt notice as much as i did	pp=1.7614583025944088
but it wouldnt occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object	pp=1.5883660608591708
he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a versatile allround man by no means confined to medicine only who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was verified bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at skerries or malahide was it	pp=1.5631832754613808
was he was bound to admit an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy pure and simple	pp=1.7038399092565268
except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains he ventured to throw out	pp=1.6502766704158258
the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at stephens at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less	pp=1.6232026071503018
grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that high educational abilities though he possessed he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet	pp=1.4163534444610835
adjacent to the mens public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way there being some little differences between the parties	pp=1.43739212795305

mezzo sovrano più_  _dice lui però_  _mezzo_  _farabutto mortacci sui_  _ma ascolta cinque la testa più_  mr bloom and stephen entered the cabmans shelter an unpretentious wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if ever been before the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skinthegoat fitzharris the invincible though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in	pp=1.637462448721212
a few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity	pp=1.4415774368523273
now touching a cup of coffee mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food say a roll of some description	pp=1.734522216385939
the _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied away though one redbearded bibulous individual portion of whose hair was greyish a sailor probably still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor	pp=1.3888951342706382
mr bloom availing himself of the right of free speech he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though to be sure rather in a quandary over _voglio_ remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious  a beautiful language	pp=1.6946386673026468

of course he subjoined pensively at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it	pp=1.5082527301621733
the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _têteàtête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun or so it seemed	pp=1.8157303314692717
after which he beat a retreat to his counter mr bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to	pp=1.9024128293011056

just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companions boot but stephen apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter answered  dedalus	pp=1.45754956441321
the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes rather bunged up from excessive use of boose preferably good old hollands and water	pp=1.5159585180474533
you know simon dedalus	pp=1.0484290373767096

mr bloom was all at sea for a moment seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too	pp=1.9390840967766405

all too irish stephen rejoined	pp=1.1212407033443794
as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark  i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder	pp=1.9078838931138733
the lefthand dead shot	pp=1.073999549379516
though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain	pp=1.7306959293348985

he turned his body half round shut up his right eye completely	pp=1.8106185327141522
then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance	pp=1.5252286033096076
pom he then shouted once	pp=1.1958189761960498
the entire audience waited anticipating an additional detonation there being still a further egg	pp=1.28090954050198
egg two evidently demolished he nodded and winked adding bloodthirstily  _buffalo bill shoots to kill  never missed nor he never will_  a silence ensued till mr bloom for agreeableness sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the bisley	pp=1.4352054552015407
beg pardon the sailor said long ago	pp=1.3503081928477403
mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth	pp=1.1785563403700299
why the sailor replied relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond it might be a matter of ten years	pp=1.7567258877451668
he toured the wide world with henglers royal circus	pp=1.2782792659577693

there were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around dublin and its picturesque environs even poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram but also farther away from the madding crowd in wicklow rightly termed the garden of ireland an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didnt come down and in the wilds of donegal where if report spoke true the _coup dœil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while howth with its historic associations and otherwise silken thomas grace omalley george iv rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young mens fancy though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally usually by the way on their left leg it being only about three quarters of an hours run from the pillar	pp=1.612560746912723
because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy so to speak and the accommodation left much to be desired	pp=1.539232807912941
interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity pure and simple was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact	pp=1.728505348277087
he turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to stephen	pp=1.9144634523524109

thats a good bit of steel repeated he examining his formidable _stiletto_	pp=1.5925417357403193
after which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors otherwise pocket	pp=1.3649458540179544
theyre great for the cold steel somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all	pp=1.8489953548899913
that was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives	pp=1.8265122220160441
at this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is bliss_ mr b	pp=1.4000713847619888
and stephen each in his own particular way both instinctively exchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however towards where skinthegoat _alias_ the keeper not turning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair	pp=1.4792544388939421
his inscrutable face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itself beggaring description conveyed the impression that he didnt understand one jot of what was going on	pp=1.507692750231299
funny very  there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause	pp=1.1771233209363916
one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with the natives _choza de_ another the seamans discharge	pp=1.4134922782220023
mr bloom so far as he was personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood	pp=1.707377648121821
he vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm figuratively speaking early in the eighties eightyone to be correct when he was just turned fifteen	pp=1.7184239658226477
ay boss the sailor broke in	pp=1.22179179307779
give us back them papers	pp=1.1632168317901832
the request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape	pp=1.5196335321492747
have you seen the rock of gibraltar	pp=1.3972295474596832
mr bloom inquired	pp=6.4766543008273345
the sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ay or no	pp=1.6988624384842792
ah youve touched there too mr bloom said europa point thinking he had in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn	pp=1.7777361593078598
what year would that be about	pp=1.2402654179034882
mr b interrogated	pp=1.5654819865880498
can you recall the boats	pp=1.2576863058442662
our _soidisant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering  im tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships	pp=1.7198862038024214
salt junk all the time	pp=1.191140159028369
tired seemingly he ceased	pp=1.0744838667133454
his questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe suffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves	pp=1.8241693815511415
on more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidently derelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall staring quite obliviously at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings	pp=1.6149247294077727
and it left him wondering why	pp=1.1939900255969185
possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under well not exactly under tempting the fates	pp=1.8110850267443606
and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all	pp=1.4833959556709224
nevertheless without going into the _minutiae_ of the business the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large no matter where living inland or seaside as the case might be having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights kish and others liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy not to say stormy weather	pp=1.71858121707199
there was a fellow sailed with me in the _rover_ the old seadog himself a rover proceeded went ashore and took up a soft job as gentlemans valet at six quid a month	pp=1.733723010576038
them are his trousers ive on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife	pp=1.6862341117154322

what age is he	pp=1.0718408029622208
queried one hearer who by the way seen from the side bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell the townclerk away from the carking cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage	pp=1.7409009877406716
why the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son danny	pp=1.6692094209650106
hed be about eighteen now way i figure it	pp=1.2765930382456476
the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor	pp=1.5945088271194867
there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater he remarked sure as nuts	pp=1.3064363561434496

suck your blood dry they does	pp=1.1517333131921639
seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariners hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUM> and a young mans sideface looking frowningly rather	pp=1.8749398885979789
tattoo the exhibitor explained	pp=1.0339435745193741
that was done when we were lying becalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton	pp=1.7228097872845927
fellow the name of antonio done that	pp=1.7892350773924879
there he is himself a greek	pp=2.199234609383174
one asked the sailor	pp=1.1404283490671836
that worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round the	pp=1.320393184527227
someway in his squeezing or	pp=1.1791086964537565
see here he said showing antonio	pp=1.4339361936095443
there he is cursing the mate	pp=1.8522842622099958
and there he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with his fingers some special knack evidently and he laughing at a yarn	pp=1.7580317693072962
and in point of fact the young man named antonios livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including skinthegoat who this time stretched over	pp=1.5068159870703453
ay ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest	pp=1.6518295769550242
hes gone too	pp=2.466433299353404
ate by sharks after ay ay	pp=1.133805313555519
he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before	pp=1.5705263165987797
neat bit of work one longshoreman said	pp=1.2185415978802818
and whats the number for	pp=1.2797160028487566
loafer number two queried eaten alive	pp=1.1804336377185805
a third asked the sailor	pp=1.1722803288320616
a greek he was	pp=1.136486946152484
and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end  as bad as old antonio for he left me on my ownio	pp=1.609176281272834
the face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill	pp=1.8238227683525299
mr bloom scarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid aside he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink	pp=1.7461660474464424
his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay the partially idiotic female namely of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you mrs b	pp=1.7482287827806027
and begged the chance of his washing	pp=1.5306916719985075
also why washing which seemed rather vague than not your washing	pp=1.277630641507097
still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wifes undergarments when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a mans similar garments initialled with bewley and drapers marking ink hers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me love my dirty shirt	pp=1.5407696291359883
still just then being on tenterhooks he desired the females room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off	pp=1.526756028305841
round the side of the _evening telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper murphys nautical chest and then there was no more of her	pp=1.9789215519243801
the gunboat the keeper said	pp=1.189208658563285
it beats me mr bloom confided to stephen medically i am speaking how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses if he values his health in the least	pp=1.5289219415575053
unfortunate creature of course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition	pp=1.5082878952535572
still no matter what the cause is from	pp=1.532636229875049
stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merely remarking  in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade	pp=1.4397965858287454
fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul	pp=1.4616283701602253
she is a bad merchant	pp=1.6099921651359974
she buys dear and sells cheap	pp=1.2120252114644534
the elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he could truthfully state he as a _paterfamilias_ was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start	pp=1.7556711980978092
whoever embarked on a policy of the sort he said and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned	pp=1.5396332430575728
you as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe in the soul	pp=1.4992532134383312
or do you mean the intelligence the brainpower as such as distinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup	pp=1.7502722365520287
i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter	pp=1.6976130520532269
otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays for instance do you	pp=1.4587041222888377
thus cornered stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say  they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible	pp=1.7948611102772973
it would be immortal i understand but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who from all i can hear is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette	pp=1.673878245918889
mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple promptly rejoining  simple	pp=1.8052513569261395
i shouldnt think that is the proper word	pp=1.7552392466239943
of course i grant you to concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon	pp=1.5470376402138395
but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays röntgen did or the telescope like edison though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man i mean and the same applies to the laws for example of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but its a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god	pp=1.6435883947267722
o that stephen expostulated has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in holy writ apart from circumstantial evidence	pp=1.3369181878347776
on this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages clashed has been	pp=1.5068618355650136
the more experienced of the two objected sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief	pp=1.6492145342552749
thats a matter for everymans opinion and without dragging in the sectarian side of the business i beg to differ with you _in toto_ there	pp=1.668044853977664
my belief is to tell you the candid truth that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or its the big question of our national poet over again who precisely wrote them like _hamlet_ and bacon as you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i of course i neednt tell you	pp=1.595478636517476
cant you drink that coffee by the way	pp=1.2800763246367743
let me stir it	pp=1.0597888158986795
and take a piece of that bun	pp=1.9416795835734195
its like one of our skippers bricks disguised	pp=1.4427284630544506
still noone can give what he hasnt got	pp=1.3553497790920699
try a bit	pp=1.2563506536798106
couldnt stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further	pp=1.6906849854130006
faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance and lucrative work	pp=1.4620131987095428
to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and useful lectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders	pp=1.6684590840737135
on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying	pp=1.875331708184424
the idea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profit there being no competition to speak of	pp=1.5226768723905753
sulphate of copper poison so<NUM> or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldnt remember when it was or where	pp=1.6564329623462002
anyhow inspection medical inspection of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr tibbles vicocoa on account of the medical analysis involved	pp=1.5955251550294958
have a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred	pp=1.630456449769721
thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage	pp=1.5418230906562889
still its solid food his good genius urged im a stickler for solid food his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work mental or manual	pp=1.52797137789011
you ought to eat more solid food	pp=1.6311208802312038
you would feel a different man	pp=1.3520866485803997
liquids i can eat stephen said	pp=1.2216342138821132
but o oblige me by taking away that knife	pp=1.3125289540184872
i cant look at the point of it	pp=2.1764663481855098
it reminds me of roman history	pp=1.5517557531776962
mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it	pp=1.4654660845022824
our mutual friends stories are like himself mr bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_	pp=1.3630100690150408
do you think they are genuine	pp=1.9162036627055983
he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots	pp=1.3720401152269406
look at him	pp=2.225496465329872
he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him	pp=1.9003494663976028
though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to baldness there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity	pp=1.4530061254808193
he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as people often did about others namely that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described	pp=1.5105670824428752
on the other hand he might be only bluffing a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs dublin residents like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _hesperus_ and etcetera	pp=1.5040592837881477
and when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldnt probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him	pp=1.439141569304672
mind you im not saying that its all a pure invention he resumed	pp=1.5352880991856321

in those waxworks in henry street i myself saw some aztecs as they are called sitting bowlegged they couldnt straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here you see he proceeded indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up being adored as gods	pp=1.5060650480710231
however reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures who reminded him a bit of ludwig _alias_ ledwidge when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the management in the _flying dutchman_ a stupendous success and his host of admirers came in large numbers everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it he conceded	pp=1.5887656213956578
on the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little italy there near the coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and he added on the cheap	pp=1.644139889424466

quite so mr bloom dittoed	pp=1.2600469468082367

skinthegoat assuming he was he evidently with an axe to grind was airing his grievances in a forciblefeeble philippic anent the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of gods earth far and away superior to england with coal in large quantities six million pounds worth of pork exported every year ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein	pp=1.6295863862662547

from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealed their strength than the opposite	pp=1.6077081123532497
it was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies equally relevant to the issue might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart	pp=1.68344638087687
another little interesting point the amours of whores and chummies to put it in common parlance reminded him irish soldiers had as often fought for england as against her more so in fact	pp=1.505189262927523
and now why	pp=3.2284476391878614
so the scene between the pair of them the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been fitzharris the famous invincible and the other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the lookeron a student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the game	pp=1.7288704755097186

quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle	pp=1.389626572355194
yet though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remaining what he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife cold steel with the courage of his political convictions though personally he would never be a party to any such thing off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south have her or swing for her when the husband frequently after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that fitz nicknamed skinthegoat merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not if he was reliably informed actually party to the ambush which in point of fact was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on	pp=1.6789379025257711

something evidently riled them in his death	pp=1.4372210332272177
either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands	pp=1.515358334321334

first it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into	pp=1.4906417643685321
since their names were coupled though since he was her declared favourite where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops the fact namely that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel having gained admittance in the same fashion a fact the weeklies addicted to the lubric a little simply coined shoals of money out of	pp=1.751305810422948
whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene strong to the verge of weakness falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties the usual sequel to bask in the loved ones smiles	pp=1.7466676162158599

a magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary that is who was just the usual everyday _farewell my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons the <NUM>th hussars to be accurate and inflammable doubtless the fallen leader that is not the other in his own peculiar way which she of course woman quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole his erstwhile staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled asss kick	pp=1.7021957311756524

stephen obviously addressed looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom with more than vision of breasts her full lips parted and some perfect teeth standing near ostensibly with gravity a piano on the rest of which was _in old madrid_ a ballad pretty in its way which was then all the vogue	pp=1.7276605321718774

the spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack tars good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself her stage presence being frankly a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to	pp=1.6703740629926231

though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering for sunshine after storm	pp=1.8770431276972497
and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion	pp=1.7665503198802723
nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves none the worse for wear however and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the others possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_	pp=1.4134435173042073

how they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations when the thing ran its normal course became in due course intimate	pp=1.5586140775192914

he b enjoyed the distinction of being close to erins uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leaders who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery leaders trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _insuppressible_ or no it was _united ireland_ a by no means by the by appropriate appellative and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the obrienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribunes private morals	pp=1.6086403753732659
though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she however was the first to perceive	pp=1.6203801364187407

his hat parnells a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and as a matter of strict history bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he as a matter of fact having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else whats bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mothers knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_ saying _thank you sir_ though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day history repeating itself with a difference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave	pp=1.8004519534268422
on the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing immoderately pretending to understand everything the why and the wherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one anothers arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others	pp=1.6534427920237043
he personally being of a sceptical bias believed and didnt make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument when neglecting her duties she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent the upshot being that her affections centred on another the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt	pp=1.599401745241969

in the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ways and flowers and chocs	pp=1.6762037056427996

for instance when the evicted tenants question then at its first inception bulked largely in peoples mind though it goes without saying not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums some of which wouldnt exactly hold water he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion a partiality however which realising his mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernans so that he though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals be it repeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows chiefly destruction of the fittest in a word	pp=1.51545813854182

the crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue somebody having a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog breed unknown with a lame paw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too to ontario terrace as he very distinctly remembered having been there so to speak	pp=1.7111313026005932

for one thing he mightnt what you call jump at the idea if approached and what mostly worried him was he didnt know how to lead up to it or word it exactly supposing he did entertain the proposal as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe if found suitable	pp=1.7541099708013062
at all events he wound up by concluding eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent a cup of eppss cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up	pp=1.6778116658514843
a move had to be made because that merry old soul the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot didnt appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some spongers bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal characters whereabouts for a few days to come alternately racking their feelings the mermaids with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybodys bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address as mr algebra remarks _passim_	pp=1.5446016046182671

to cut a long story short bloom grasping the situation was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming making a grand total of fourpence the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers literally the last of the mohicans he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures coffee <NUM>d confectionery do and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way as wetherup used to remark	pp=1.642315813788043

so saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companions right a habit of his by the bye his right side being in classical idiom his tender achilles	pp=1.6371092308538018
the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins	pp=1.6777278530052877

accordingly he passed his left arm in stephens right and led him on accordingly	pp=1.6516791964946616

and _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings	pp=1.7111389662676861
wagnerian music though confessedly grand in its way was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to follow at the first gooff but the music of mercadantes _huguenots_ meyerbeers _seven last words on the cross_ and mozarts _twelfth mass_ he simply revelled in the _gloria_ in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat	pp=1.6002961813037673
he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those moody and sankey hymns or _bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be_	pp=1.6058181882405043
he also yielded to none in his admiration of rossinis _stabat mater_ a work simply abounding in immortal numbers in which his wife madam marion tweedy made a hit a veritable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers church in upper gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos or _virtuosi_ rather	pp=1.495580198931422
there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore	pp=1.998464304926457
on the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _don giovanni_ description and _martha_ a gem in its line he had a _penchant_ though with only a surface knowledge for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn	pp=1.5754884775702325
and talking of that taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites he mentioned _par excellence_ lionels air in _martha mappari_ which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be more accurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips of stephens respected father sung to perfection a study of the number in fact which made all the others take a back seat	pp=1.6136847051285064
stephen in reply to a politely put query said he didnt sing it but launched out into praises of shakespeares songs at least of in or about that period the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist who _anno ludendo hausi doulandus_ an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch whom b	pp=1.403483693468539

on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse dragging a sweeper paced on the paven ground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull	pp=1.5123102841805387
he inquired if it was john bull the political celebrity of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as a striking coincidence	pp=1.6021486027994014

they thereupon stopped	pp=1.1006218637041274
bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker a hipshaker a blackbuttocker a taildangler a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts	pp=1.7352985785443154
but such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadnt a lump of sugar but as he wisely reflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up	pp=1.606079544838518

a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that the rarest of boons which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of b a	pp=1.5396832073478337
a huge ad in its way and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he a youthful tyro in societys sartorial niceties hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you	pp=1.6373101678933248
it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic _conversaziones_ during the festivities of the christmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of which as he happened to know were on recordin fact without giving the show away he himself once upon a time if he cared to could easily have	pp=1.69649677688948

besides though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree original music like that different from the conventional rut would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublins musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by ivan st austell and hilton st just and their _genus omne_	pp=1.496815239241851
yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the citys esteem where he could command a stiff figure and booking ahead give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street house given a backerup if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs so to speak a big _if_ however with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows	pp=1.777827442223873

and later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who he noticed was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present deprecate him or whatever you like to call it which in blooms humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a persons character no pun intended	pp=1.5007430294589061

mulveys was the first when i was in bed that morning and mrs rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when i asked her to hand me and i pointing at them i couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <NUM> or a <NUM> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the union jack flying with all her carabineros because <NUM> drunken english sailors took all the rock from them and because i didnt run into mass often enough in santa maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <NUM> times on easter sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his majestad an admirer he signed it i near jumped out of my skin i wanted to pick him up when i saw him following me along the calle real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but i never thought hed write making an appointment i had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing i remember shall i wear a white rose and i wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young i put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did i tell him i was engaged for for fun to the son of a spanish nobleman named don miguel de la flora and he believed me that i was to be married to him in <NUM> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things i told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the spanish girls he didnt like i suppose one of them wouldnt have him i got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till i taught him cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left may yes it was may when the infant king of spain was born im always like that in the spring id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near oharas tower i told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old barbary apes they sent to clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back mrs rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me i had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as i could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump i said i was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place i suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and saint michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there i was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had i could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but i wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after i tried with the banana but i was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes o yes i pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but i opened my legs i wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because i had a skirt opening up the side i tormented the life out of him first tickling him i loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same i liked him like that moaning i made him blush a little when i got over him that way when i unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them molly darling he called

them at him he went to india he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to

under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that gibraltar only that cheap peau despagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else i wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy claddagh ring for luck that i gave gardner going to south africa where those boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if

suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but i saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns o how nice i said whatever i liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in lloyds weekly news <NUM> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from i couldnt rest easy till i bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure i heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows still its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im certain the way he plots and plans everything out i couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless i bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when i put the chair against the door just as i was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that i got that little italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUM> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him i suppose he thinks im finished out and laid on the shelf well im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with tom devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of murray girls calling for her can milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in nelson street riding harry devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose i smelt it off her dress when i was biting off the thread of the button i sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i tell you only i oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <NUM> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the only way in the theatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching me afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the gaiety for beerbohm tree in trilby the last time ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft i think i saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside switzers window at the same little game i recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the broadstone going away well i hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way i did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet i never came properly till i was what <NUM> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that conny connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and supper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to put her hair up at <NUM> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way i was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when i asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met mrs joe gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till i gave her <NUM> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting i was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or i didnt sleep the night before cheese i ate was it and i

dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us i wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head i ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat i told her and

auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that michael gunn gave him to see mrs kendal and her husband at the gaiety something he did about insurance for him in drimmies i was fit to be tied though i wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about spinoza and his soul thats dead i suppose millions of years ago i smiled the best i could all in a swamp leaning forward as if i was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag i wont forget that wife of scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted i suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it i wish he had what i had then hed boo i bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what o patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is i dont want to ruin the clean sheets i just put on i suppose the clean linen i wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <NUM> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply o jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens i suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till i suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom i wonder is it nicer in the day i think it is easy i think ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me i might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode i wonder was i too heavy sitting on his knee i made him sit on the easychair purposely when i took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me i hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy god i remember one time i could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy o lord how noisy i hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget i bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy god i wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman o lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy o how the waters come down at lahore  who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have i something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last i whit monday yes its only about <NUM> weeks i ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before i married him when i had that white thing coming from me and floey made me go to that dry old stick dr collins for womens diseases on pembroke road your vagina he called it i suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right i wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what i did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if i smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments i suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the rock of gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it i suppose i always used to know by millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had i frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways i wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap o anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my precious one everything connected with your glorious body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <NUM> and <NUM> times a day sometimes and i said i hadnt are you sure o yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him up i knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me i dont know how the first night ever we met when i was living in rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <NUM> minutes as if we met somewhere i suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the doyles said he was going to stand for a member of parliament o wasnt i the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the huguenots to sing in french to be more classy o beau pays de la touraine that i never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very <NUM>st opportunity he got a chance in brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the albion milk and sulphur soap i used to use and the gelatine still round it o i laughed myself sick at him that day i better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it i suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god he took me to show one wet sunday in the museum in kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and our lords both put together all over asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes i know i hope the old press doesnt creak ah i knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her o this nuisance of a thing i hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up god help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old cohen i suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from lord napier that i used to admire when i was a little girl because i told him easy piano o i like my bed god here we are as bad as ever after <NUM> years how many houses were we in at all raymond terrace and ontario terrace and lombard street and holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <NUM> sticks of furniture and then the city arms hotel worse and worse says warden daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it thoms and helys and mr cuffes and drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the freeman too like the rest on account of those sinner fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers i saw on him wait theres georges church bells wait <NUM> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first ill look at his shirt to see or ill see if he has that french letter still in his pocketbook i suppose he thinks i dont know deceitful men all their <NUM> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the aristocrats masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs i suppose im nothing any more when i wouldnt let him lick me in holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so i thought i stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or i dont know what he forgets that wethen i dont ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles i wonder was it her josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and boylan though as for her denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when i was with him with milly at the college races that hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down i tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of mr paddy dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black l boom and tom kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens w c drunk in some place or other and martin cunningham and the two dedaluses and fanny mcoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day i see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially jack power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if i can help it making fun of him then behind his back i know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor paddy dignam all the same im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <NUM> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting bill bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the glencree dinner and ben dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <NUM> in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and simon dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when i sang maritana with him at freddy mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like bartell darcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath o maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to may goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the kingsbridge station with his father and mother i was in mourning thats <NUM> years ago now yes hed be <NUM> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me i heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat i suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when i saw him at mat dillons he liked me too i remember they all do wait by god yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before i thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the <NUM>th card after that the <NUM> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <NUM> queens and the <NUM> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <NUM> red <NUM>s for new garments look at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord byron and not an ounce of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUM> i was married <NUM> milly is <NUM> yesterday <NUM> what age was he then at dillons <NUM> or <NUM> about <NUM> i suppose hes <NUM> or more im not too old for him if hes <NUM> or <NUM> i hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from tarifa the lighthouse at europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and billy prescotts ad and keyess ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men i could see down in margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought i could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face i would too in <NUM><NUM> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men i suppose never dream of washing it from <NUM> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure itll be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age ill throw them the <NUM>st thing in the morning till i see if the wishcard comes out or ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUM> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though  no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because i didnt call him hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of julius caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of marrowbone lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course the man never even casts a <NUM>nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing i suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <NUM> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <NUM> lumps of lard before ever id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUM> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could i only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the love of mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great suggester don poldo de la flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUM> <NUM>s too in prison for lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket i knitted crying as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well id never have another our <NUM>st death too it was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting god knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUM> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar delapaz delagracia they had the devils queer names there father vilaplana of santa maria that gave me the rosary rosales y oreilly in the calle las siete revueltas and pisimbo and mrs opisso in governor street o what a name id go and drown myself in the first river if i had a name like her o my and all the bits of streets paradise ramp and bedlam ramp and rodgers ramp and crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if i am a harumscarum i know i am a bit i declare to god i dont feel a day older than then i wonder could i get my tongue round any of the spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see i havent forgotten it all i thought i had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity i never tried to read that novel cantankerous mrs rubio lent me by valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in abrines i could do the criada the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <NUM> he can make it for <NUM> im sure im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that i badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in walpoles only <NUM><NUM> or <NUM><NUM> ill just give him one more chance ill get up early in the morning im sick of cohens old bed in any case i might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the <NUM>st man id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning mamy dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when i used to be in the longing way then ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger i suppose hed like my nice cream too i know what ill do ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta masetto then ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him <NUM> or <NUM> times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet i wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless i made him stand there and put him into me ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if i am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said o much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears god knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it i suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or he wouldnt have made us the way he did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <NUM> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then ill tell him i want  <NUM> or perhaps <NUM> ill tell him i want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad i dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do i could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers o i suppose that cant be helped ill do the indifferent <NUM> or <NUM> questions ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back i know every turn in him ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then ill suggest about yes o wait now sonny my turn is coming ill be quite gay and friendly over it o but i was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then ill go out ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour i suppose theyre just getting up in china now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in
