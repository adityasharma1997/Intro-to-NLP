my dear mr	pp=2.96065138462632
but it is returned she for mrs	pp=55.093779787963776
this was invitation enough	pp=7.392878955185373
but my dear you must indeed go and see mr	pp=48.4476629382189
bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood	pp=17.05346648943422
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them	pp=24.915999260348077
you are over scrupulous surely	pp=41.53356042715967
you have no compassion on my poor nerves	pp=105.51093232291598
you mistake me my dear	pp=3.019541083722551
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least	pp=103.47812966046305
it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them	pp=127.29484113523569
bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character	pp=176.53556197518805
he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it	pp=81.1469517085545
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with  i hope mr	pp=122.63465983022913
we are not in a way to know _what_ mr	pp=41.53281097785458
bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit	pp=47.763798790292896
dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake have a little compassion on my nerves	pp=111.42601713847093
when is your next ball to be lizzy tomorrow fortnight	pp=113.41201457408168
i cannot quite agree with you _there_	pp=43.223972782360924
what say you mary	pp=14.28367132923091
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs	pp=52.653973466217444
how good it was in you my dear mr	pp=17.491689316818164
lydia my love though you _are_ the youngest i dare say mr	pp=59.439546238870726
they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas	pp=250.35663497175307
her report was highly favourable	pp=25.90748302155204
bingleys heart were entertained	pp=11.135978326442029
bingley returned mr	pp=7.5785544506488804
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs	pp=56.72683412186577
bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all mr	pp=142.07300142594127
bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation c mrs	pp=76.90924162056213
and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr	pp=263.74260098304757
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr	pp=89.9928094558905
darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr	pp=54.625360173953375
i certainly shall not	pp=1.8038712986840504
you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner	pp=118.99979314830118
your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with	pp=45.95398295270872
first of all he asked miss lucas	pp=26.635271492921433
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance	pp=72.92840171497096
so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next	pp=121.55367151970403
i dare say the lace upon mrs	pp=88.95470208614655
bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him	pp=42.24227503500129
well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him	pp=60.234900239827596
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes	pp=110.72346503798366
certainly not at first	pp=1.7615032249494371
in understanding darcy was the superior	pp=19.12323481816325
jamess had made him courteous	pp=14.88547372898306
_you_ began the evening well charlotte said mrs	pp=55.28939741561301
ohyou mean jane i supposebecause he danced with her twice	pp=18.47171943621765
long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise	pp=132.14891077847014
i believe maam i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him	pp=62.191155479888195
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself	pp=117.5895022670111
by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary	pp=89.62133532018248
vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously	pp=347.63101019509526
darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was	pp=87.41803103377669
miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs	pp=86.362532370185
but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow	pp=69.70361778006951
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together	pp=165.29438791868077
when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses	pp=51.425028250632444
she has known him only a fortnight	pp=16.744147079573505
not as you represent it	pp=25.73212133286318
yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded	pp=160.7144572855908
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least	pp=148.29182394263742
you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound	pp=30.056016213491457
bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend mr	pp=63.065594652223886
of this she was perfectly unawareto her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with	pp=76.4638319039175
darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar withkeep your breath to cool your porridgeand i shall keep mine to swell my song	pp=578.1029874294088
darcythere is nothing like dancing after alli consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies	pp=110.65081542743778
you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour mr	pp=137.7191398683193
i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all these peoplewhat would i give to hear your strictures on them  your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you	pp=304.32311101425495
the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt	pp=287.30170960790133
i am astonished my dear said mrs	pp=7.777916005394357
this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree	pp=43.41368047271785
bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read  well jane who is it from	pp=128.60932806777814
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this	pp=14.537328036666379
dining out said mrs	pp=2.767477697456597
that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home	pp=74.1908155819838
but if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers purpose will be answered	pp=184.37370815371114
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth  my dearest lizzy  i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday	pp=232.29450234386744
well my dear said mr	pp=1.5800696014975177
oh i am not at all afraid of her dying	pp=27.674761656004925
she will be taken good care of	pp=42.40622244591709
i would go and see her if i could have the carriage	pp=28.332637021152262
how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there	pp=51.482102282827476
is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses no indeed	pp=56.95332895641933
the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles	pp=128.72642002000634
i shall be back by dinner	pp=55.10359092393492
she was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindnessmr	pp=187.87574579250892
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	pp=78.78701899788268
his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others	pp=162.2850187192223
miss bingley was engrossed by mr	pp=17.399706910296167
i could hardly keep my countenance	pp=19.95923910537968
your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me	pp=150.35082565622764
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum	pp=393.79108334117757
i am afraid mr	pp=8.764264569751193
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself	pp=105.03509036166211
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room	pp=67.92976492095413
charles when you build _your_ house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley	pp=235.72132231624863
i wish it may	pp=4.146441386771199
it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are	pp=108.44778498053711
all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean	pp=44.256598203299134
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished	pp=60.23408716258053
yes i do comprehend a great deal in it	pp=14.770320715018984
_i_ never saw such a woman	pp=3.367276515318473
hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr	pp=305.09628779648295
bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters	pp=124.71121102668884
removed cried bingley	pp=2.8119780121560844
it must not be thought of	pp=10.646640618273736
you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us mrs	pp=85.57676896022751
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_	pp=74.93927419636563
you begin to comprehend me do you	pp=32.58525922884102
i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful	pp=122.25171435196098
but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever	pp=101.8379781940136
the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley	pp=38.5297197235395
ayethat is because you have the right disposition	pp=33.369789001675514
his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr	pp=119.31041642734564
elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away	pp=170.15504189247628
what an agreeable man sir william is mr	pp=17.318647602270463
bingley _i_ always keep servants that can do their own work _my_ daughters are brought up differently	pp=382.1518972126279
but however he did not	pp=3.496896785666745
perhaps he thought her too young	pp=29.66445458932854
however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were	pp=69.44468593940248
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love  i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love said darcy	pp=282.854464071744
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr	pp=16.891152339769814
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr	pp=87.37442551562965
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear	pp=197.74426993663855
bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr	pp=111.9681665857771
darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister mr	pp=196.26905891617517
i mend pens remarkably well	pp=7.6989778946433445
thank youbut i always mend my own	pp=36.072984375905556
it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill	pp=307.57261667615063
he leaves out half his words and blots the rest	pp=82.00078715782925
and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment	pp=50.25396850718937
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could would mr	pp=152.09195246665803
allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety	pp=282.72440172605235
darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection	pp=80.25169313752417
will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties	pp=207.10313198306292
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference	pp=109.04316036662507
perhaps i do	pp=3.827467104640882
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself mrs	pp=299.2225760906708
oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply	pp=48.30199177483372
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if you dare	pp=127.2074574225206
miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth	pp=280.773830519957
have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity	pp=99.77433707081946
as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes	pp=236.31942060528695
it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied	pp=300.9693953931963
hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out	pp=70.89455060171817
she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two	pp=75.07797163219497
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object	pp=32.43830413125562
darcy did not wish for cards and mr	pp=34.792415088137844
hurst soon found even his open petition rejected	pp=202.0773914896249
hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep	pp=76.99178246223765
darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs	pp=50.792982055997975
she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on	pp=265.0839552523095
if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards	pp=278.23796442074126
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day	pp=114.71574147128324
darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives	pp=105.47780417386461
i never heard any thing so abominable	pp=24.864711524322594
how shall we punish him for such a speech	pp=59.69830270386048
darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth	pp=25.39264218510749
that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance	pp=80.67532478603157
miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be	pp=42.75400734302133
follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i canbut these i suppose are precisely what you are without	pp=351.1735937295906
such as vanity and pride	pp=9.763243064123396
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	pp=32.7409049997857
your examination of mr	pp=3.425549217466055
darcy has no defect	pp=13.372549704428307
my temper would perhaps be called resentfulmy good opinion once lost is lost for ever	pp=121.20305915788768
but you have chosen your fault welli really cannot _laugh_ at it	pp=301.78122234138726
there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome	pp=361.03248596930257
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention chapter xii	pp=107.68493744972044
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr	pp=148.58409281691482
bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very wellagainst staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr	pp=512.0055970116495
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right to mr	pp=106.15261494891652
miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the formerelizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits	pp=134.0437037173968
much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married chapter xiii	pp=177.93602336178606
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained	pp=108.41362083260829
oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned	pp=29.770363749412784
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs	pp=34.78745552728755
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr	pp=47.31681091792607
no my dear i think not	pp=16.66553354592133
there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his letter which promises well	pp=151.9219609972856
in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective	pp=219.76134536469175
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	pp=116.53615176168101
bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily  you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough	pp=128.675271402938
things are settled so oddly	pp=26.205423529657256
not that i mean to find fault with _you_ for such things i know are all chance in this world	pp=204.02255813929781
the hall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs	pp=183.72506127728045
bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen	pp=61.13475700944773
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her	pp=176.03313171287283
is she handsome	pp=23.645702417991703
she is a most charming young lady indeed	pp=45.35706979100219
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth	pp=199.76621324855915
they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible mr	pp=354.9976606598233
my aunt told me so herself on saturday	pp=32.25818270504451
denny comes back from town	pp=12.958578988424875
collins much offended laid aside his book and said  i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit	pp=286.6920186841769
bennet and prepared for backgammon chapter xv mr	pp=45.600978467440534
having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	pp=159.11720193505852
collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soon donedone while mrs	pp=126.61995553240111
bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr	pp=50.042509424742825
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly	pp=21.86933937812881
in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton	pp=164.73816677971385
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them	pp=258.73088214985324
all were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot mr	pp=256.99821305564376
wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps	pp=118.30062238997485
both changed colour one looked white the other red mr	pp=130.65714103553367
what could be the meaning of itit was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know	pp=36.18980393742596
in another minute mr	pp=4.228792608190285
denny and mr	pp=4.618234543321377
philipss house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs	pp=158.88904237468898
philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr	pp=197.35582503865228
some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr	pp=38.3412862476436
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before	pp=131.2649136428239
collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs	pp=9.798438926215885
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs	pp=123.47685821924141
philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could	pp=158.30431436564362
it was over at last however	pp=22.649809698851897
i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs	pp=102.44568805178122
philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason mr	pp=117.00944618066244
wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia	pp=141.30033101225064
wickham began the subject himself	pp=17.519937061499938
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myselffor i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	pp=144.7856224247581
it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial	pp=14.677165213478794
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere elsehere you are in your own family	pp=108.66686933345261
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire	pp=30.729262867192535
i should take him even on _my_ slight acquaintance to be an illtempered man	pp=180.64334020978416
wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry	pp=383.0761047665419
society i own is necessary to me	pp=26.101543468941337
i can recal nothing worse	pp=10.331224801748242
but what said she after a pause can have been his motivewhat can have induced him to behave so cruelly	pp=122.95500608323022
_my_ father began life in the profession which your uncle mr	pp=85.28276177082539
philips appears to do so much credit tobut he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr	pp=54.71455304446196
how strange cried elizabeth	pp=1.4730934226579844
but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride	pp=166.16792635681864
what sort of a girl is miss darcy	pp=9.316567378979649
but she is nothing to me now	pp=17.571600828092144
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying  i am astonished at his intimacy with mr	pp=105.03695125082557
collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs	pp=56.794553642271
philipsthe usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter	pp=59.11183281626068
i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent	pp=90.93075611624494
elizabeth went away with her head full of him	pp=27.94706004744809
elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr	pp=12.239739249787629
it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side	pp=246.22493550463355
bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others	pp=35.285780409104206
bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr	pp=89.23199927807289
wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr	pp=40.48275055369576
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in	pp=43.311592205737355
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr	pp=184.45724510718662
darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr	pp=75.84305104320988
the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification mr	pp=195.00626795250403
collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give	pp=230.72722551859505
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy	pp=77.10585829732354
how near it may be to _mine_ i cannot pretend to say_you_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly	pp=140.94238662603507
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir	pp=27.657016103325255
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselveswe have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine	pp=209.18168706363113
said he smiling	pp=40.59232371429651
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her  so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickhamyour sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcys steward	pp=186.32088039136758
darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr	pp=146.71594766182272
i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr	pp=18.199343491256396
darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sisters mr	pp=23.369421413398523
bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr	pp=155.26285792561666
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment	pp=137.90320381518848
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it	pp=161.89324034867113
on their being joined by mr	pp=17.089852860569497
how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting withperhapsa nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assemblyi am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before	pp=127.80262579913332
darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintancemr	pp=75.60149578938905
collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility mr	pp=62.188283143313186
i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception mr	pp=31.17038142859588
he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily	pp=135.13565259385362
what is mr	pp=8.479763603680825
darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him	pp=22.871429667744337
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone	pp=105.17681984358713
darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable	pp=100.24420226248289
she was teazed by mr	pp=7.833654010257435
there was no arguing upon such a project	pp=69.6937898687965
darcy said nothing at all mr	pp=6.436274775904158
bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other	pp=125.02625806519306
bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time mrs	pp=82.5353234656678
bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months	pp=165.0852015225842
collins made his declaration in form	pp=67.74115856207993
having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business	pp=231.20364759411325
i am going away myself	pp=15.250869113758
bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr collins began	pp=25.69193115749231
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections	pp=120.01686736033335
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did	pp=93.98989208148059
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs	pp=171.97312238962144
collins you must marry	pp=6.625498413896991
a clergyman like you must marrychuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake and for your _own_ let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way	pp=327.85264710910803
find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her	pp=33.254663214798036
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the <NUM> per cents	pp=117.39860786816588
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	pp=20.701313716688023
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration	pp=373.5322447918142
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time	pp=58.368375330313675
were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr	pp=29.86114978045405
collins very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you	pp=70.62116614329071
this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled	pp=50.49180758749157
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible	pp=59.39493285468219
collins and lizzy	pp=17.068384663760046
collins and mr	pp=6.096097869073568
bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library	pp=23.631385902221968
i have sent for you on an affair of importance	pp=51.54591925858476
is it true	pp=33.22239543624645
is not it so mrs bennet	pp=12.811000945469072
an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth	pp=18.61616048303009
bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed	pp=126.30715197674175
bennet by talking in this way	pp=8.547155956265438
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be	pp=32.67511359988458
not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs	pp=35.53517731712216
though her manner varied however her determination never did mr	pp=184.71754077576037
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them	pp=62.16460527872406
pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves	pp=310.08588782092363
aye there she comes continued mrs	pp=26.906593060955423
nobody can tell what i sufferbut it is always so	pp=42.631702230711966
she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr	pp=51.57336131385194
collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls  now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr	pp=155.95080331748852
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr	pp=134.4868536646928
collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear	pp=93.06640606380229
collins  my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point	pp=73.32979559177815
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise chapter xxi	pp=205.42868284225017
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her	pp=163.25377464016353
the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again	pp=87.29882308955648
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr	pp=287.0078486821714
the next was in these words	pp=10.683960821939321
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sistersmr	pp=298.78336042193604
caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter	pp=52.62299084660301
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you	pp=285.62519526597544
i will have no reserves from _you_ mr	pp=13.785078131852622
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy	pp=150.6085184123313
but i know the foundation is unjust	pp=44.58401756612074
but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required	pp=95.90947320930701
they agreed that mrs	pp=4.633499514615036
collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself	pp=104.19872069850007
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet	pp=206.07802451320708
bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr	pp=160.87099883033525
the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maid	pp=335.3589013836306
charlotte herself was tolerably composed	pp=52.49670547710752
collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary	pp=150.00052057037826
bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	pp=79.22261845207726
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr	pp=176.35781118856022
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again	pp=188.36676363237945
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return	pp=281.07007034639446
bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr	pp=64.78890155713269
bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood	pp=90.63932980813316
even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	pp=107.92399493676564
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring	pp=205.80342186911972
as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence	pp=166.15929123860084
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr	pp=66.07738847016158
i never can be thankful mr	pp=18.717722244895462
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr	pp=155.14943669071718
pride and prejudice  a novel	pp=1.316321171277182
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country	pp=95.20574863675385
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort	pp=171.65160268356635
it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing	pp=147.13000627727044
she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded	pp=256.8353213039015
bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying  oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	pp=178.68088092209018
with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself	pp=104.32792766738703
my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good	pp=52.40548995700178
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection	pp=340.601297740556
collinss respectability and charlottes prudent steady character	pp=170.7795627675388
remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin	pp=124.35372119189044
to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart	pp=163.41880699299182
you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas	pp=70.06283739061058
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together	pp=103.16883528454674
but enough of this	pp=3.500124119136969
i am far from attributing any part of mr	pp=27.091945400891444
you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him	pp=51.79050976239975
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable	pp=192.54550667702017
if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed	pp=100.65754958121116
let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood	pp=73.84051261959226
so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find	pp=50.36298686062518
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country	pp=34.92464982671894
bennet and mrs	pp=6.075703273100965
bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of	pp=57.019653316823636
gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation	pp=126.03363188402321
we do not suffer by _accident_	pp=102.94936989841618
gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her	pp=95.18764073753754
bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner	pp=43.2849331285566
you have sense and we all expect you to use it	pp=53.75880956806537
my dear aunt this is being serious indeed	pp=96.47620927199912
elizabeth you are not serious now	pp=9.251750891617583
darcymy fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it	pp=82.61830148703729
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week	pp=85.91850611888061
as they went down stairs together charlotte said  i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza	pp=78.73348435333497
elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit	pp=147.1511719458614
the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging	pp=107.96749338785311
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is	pp=190.5494978817068
my aunt she continued is going tomorrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenorstreet	pp=85.7648659613532
he was well but so much engaged with mr	pp=24.60453154486129
four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him	pp=28.615918848953694
i cannot understand it	pp=2.357434915955475
if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this	pp=100.42441595120476
we had better not mention it	pp=10.55559851321603
i am sure you will be very comfortable there yours c	pp=32.08377076208172
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly	pp=77.54458352256198
they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain chapter iv	pp=153.0907077227382
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr collins	pp=150.61741597179338
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter	pp=36.916418958818035
_he_ shall be mercenary and _she_ shall be foolish	pp=75.91043353926979
oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we _do_ return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing	pp=158.7003781279799
once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear	pp=181.13992625560772
but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house	pp=261.76809946717515
collins joining in observed  yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her	pp=66.90582782957142
jenkinson who lives with them	pp=4.184272703345693
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in	pp=56.66866698759139
she looks sickly and crossyes she will do for him very well	pp=49.45951461154685
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed	pp=117.43817628560106
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the parkevery park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr	pp=131.34003769321995
collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh	pp=157.09693347705502
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation	pp=366.6922965007637
in spite of having been at st	pp=24.34318392685544
her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank	pp=149.12911887077567
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others	pp=228.0763156918495
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education	pp=74.57550873738808
elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case	pp=31.167234665050476
then who taught you	pp=4.052592494253728
those who chose to be idle certainly might	pp=44.96600949181227
lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure	pp=31.188843404950493
are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet	pp=44.23276328272079
collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered	pp=37.17829258968708
sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with	pp=145.1257212481756
collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road	pp=175.5278359043766
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards	pp=92.74759656055103
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out	pp=41.33974062001288
collinss joints of meat were too large for her family	pp=104.33156730552275
collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty	pp=456.1139367594843
darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself	pp=157.5746610277836
collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence	pp=196.08719662873455
collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him	pp=19.874027011995274
colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman mr	pp=280.01764144782885
darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs	pp=61.4725030378947
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs	pp=149.3699975344956
the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away chapter viii	pp=102.17923400898697
she practises very constantly	pp=11.447862366462338
she would be in nobodys way you know in that part of the house mr	pp=60.421945284602614
he drew a chair near her	pp=22.974443213373267
lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance	pp=340.4863293544666
elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said  you mean to frighten me mr	pp=161.0285727049348
but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well	pp=77.51813647667583
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me	pp=55.011842103416335
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a balland at this ball what do you think he did	pp=90.43304197357402
he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr	pp=102.18755121644615
perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	pp=142.11376506950336
my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do	pp=182.73907400756926
she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes	pp=122.37286819366008
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ had she been his relation	pp=143.31576019855305
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs	pp=50.64977323038197
darcy only entered the room	pp=1.5068375769525884
bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before	pp=137.73124777623437
but perhaps mr	pp=9.737520313635196
i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object mr	pp=127.73150366945731
my friend has an excellent understandingthough i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr	pp=79.35054081619371
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends	pp=63.554553852769146
the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances	pp=187.36085283076739
darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away	pp=57.55107720669953
what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was gone	pp=10.387313243950869
but why mr	pp=9.45467079614763
colonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it outshe watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success	pp=173.02056047731708
collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too	pp=200.7425749766805
she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter	pp=80.84566123269056
do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she	pp=45.30006488822764
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy	pp=54.83782183885522
but so we all do	pp=6.221986970078932
in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either	pp=46.484239216255396
younger sons cannot marry where they like	pp=23.267724821267567
our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money	pp=256.4437308210446
she directly replied  you need not be frightened	pp=14.684899872989781
hurst and miss bingley	pp=1.024421441096809
it was all conjecture	pp=17.0888640653992
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley	pp=32.44301660335568
he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling	pp=109.64734926177894
all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating	pp=236.66464630748732
neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr	pp=167.4118990123658
darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach	pp=113.59720101690944
they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering	pp=494.59774022431105
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do	pp=144.4064883619483
but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr	pp=94.85267574026679
darcy walk into the room	pp=2.2298087314276533
he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room	pp=35.25156026393145
this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed	pp=129.46113701271324
she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done	pp=73.34566723617785
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you	pp=19.6384972310587
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity	pp=16.926841334421926
towards _him_ i have been kinder than towards myself	pp=81.91551582689293
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself	pp=142.12273403853476
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him	pp=46.56462929336477
they were natural and just	pp=7.838160482564165
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own	pp=137.9888887374608
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness	pp=92.10379392648997
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great	pp=51.09210580615087
her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it	pp=22.078846418454198
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park	pp=59.108978392862745
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees	pp=105.15097754161569
wickhamwilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparisonbut from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been readif in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorrythe necessity must be obeyedand farther apology would be absurdi had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the countrybut it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachmenti had often seen him in love beforeat that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage	pp=223.3632623512722
your sister i also watchedher look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentimentif _you_ have not been mistaken here _i_ must have been in an error	pp=383.37621774043026
but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touchedthat i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certainbut i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fearsi did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished iti believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reasonmy objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to mebut there were other causes of repugnancecauses which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before methese causes must be stated though brieflythe situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your fatherpardon meit pains me to offend you	pp=347.9711324995209
i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of itthat they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probablebut his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some dangerperhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath meit is done however and it was done for the beston this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer	pp=237.406887606358
wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family	pp=94.64153219355755
his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr	pp=211.57359376475847
he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein	pp=70.43512906111205
i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal	pp=100.12617866771264
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being	pp=166.5145071973244
wickham who left the place immediately and mrs	pp=27.598775859272642
wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement	pp=183.96895030043547
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her	pp=73.63235611195586
in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	pp=151.7791195178985
darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words	pp=157.84813065520328
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err	pp=100.42842003028127
but no such recollection befriended her	pp=66.30232367826946
she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess	pp=227.31525333026028
darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration	pp=61.86610127909302
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr	pp=172.74718859389512
bingley was incomprehensible	pp=37.73968347640263
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object	pp=19.552400821059482
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her	pp=103.19708066326277
were questions with which she amused herself	pp=43.00167393567863
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings partyi assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do	pp=98.12036593353642
why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks	pp=101.48309034688835
it is highly improper	pp=10.89124344558735
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone	pp=130.6521794406776
my uncle is to send a servant for us	pp=23.777321989021413
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what chance could there be of improvement	pp=136.39046597338984
his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend	pp=213.45907051558618
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make _her_ feel the obliged mr	pp=171.84370266519957
her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms	pp=228.5262755117999
gardiner though unknown	pp=32.36493371372457
he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings	pp=156.0922118796211
we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twicehow much i shall have to tell  elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal	pp=238.43800888093145
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them	pp=131.62453673479268
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals	pp=232.30228701380415
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther chapter xvi	pp=202.90617554728522
bennets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up stairs	pp=259.5613977467698
they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all	pp=125.7172401479427
mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have  yes thought elizabeth _that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once	pp=242.83651448049287
what do you think	pp=1.2771535421602278
but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone	pp=51.64161472051247
there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king	pp=93.98022188032041
theres for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay	pp=82.9685148293243
dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters	pp=103.0204267303388
forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least	pp=160.5109334046502
their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs	pp=278.01038795715425
i was ready to die of laughter	pp=33.597420753790075
she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	pp=46.64960015985016
she was sorry that mr	pp=4.167538696565687
indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me	pp=76.03650992700248
what a stroke was this for poor jane who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual	pp=258.9372104250065
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other	pp=168.29812545363538
wickham so very bad it is almost past belief	pp=105.28032648406399
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men	pp=90.49653399745061
darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do	pp=23.450135887545102
and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you  how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr	pp=146.62048205551744
i am not equal to it	pp=12.600987616109295
for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody	pp=31.65352517460295
they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens	pp=90.20501590636324
the dejection was almost universal	pp=27.77077937978669
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbournhouse	pp=289.70180078348744
darcys objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend	pp=80.97969033303876
this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married	pp=22.753409483158514
if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair	pp=199.10208415627304
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret	pp=92.08484191722944
her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous	pp=160.3140837060171
let her go then	pp=9.503932044274116
let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance	pp=127.12133829204073
at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life	pp=205.94342686823833
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition	pp=241.16032290213138
in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness	pp=165.7448033359625
she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once	pp=500.84446977548504
elizabeth was now to see mr	pp=9.2536792160579
on the very last day of the regiments remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr	pp=113.64365096262588
her answer was warmly in his favour	pp=26.481896930504018
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say that he was at rosings	pp=42.550311631126455
oh no said elizabeth	pp=2.188185837960415
in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was	pp=31.30129529333523
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him	pp=89.47342172989782
forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning	pp=78.56471273289411
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic	pp=98.78929169638336
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard chapter xix	pp=154.4635518032597
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn	pp=133.74535120396462
everything wore a happier aspect	pp=38.83920723360682
gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire	pp=235.58854098268552
but they did pass away and mr and mrs	pp=12.021882822589694
one enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad	pp=664.028562946151
the possibility of meeting mr	pp=20.51579965884946
it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk	pp=98.26409762369681
but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered	pp=129.04713188288233
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer	pp=180.36109590610536
by the author of sense and sensibility vol iii	pp=4.348127421716627
as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen	pp=522.5371245123758
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and auntbut norecollecting herselfthat could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them	pp=173.09945173127068
gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it	pp=20.75521401500221
it was drawn at the same time as the otherabout eight years ago	pp=32.33487794704799
i have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs	pp=96.74852064804111
gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face	pp=41.765476835340245
but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not mrs	pp=104.76087151570381
yes very handsome	pp=8.434921069281772
wickhams being among them mrs	pp=12.117716889477173
i do not know who is good enough for him mr and mrs gardiner smiled	pp=17.39440555215892
i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him replied the other	pp=60.38484573471588
that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion	pp=119.21546147992069
yes sir i know i am	pp=5.960282053387105
perhaps we might be deceived	pp=6.8973554178318865
in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger	pp=107.05951869693035
at last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance of mr	pp=77.68321411465547
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance	pp=123.95259927160552
they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight	pp=111.63673429042018
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family	pp=144.4186862181051
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was not like ease	pp=160.53194184337286
elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs	pp=139.6590672119513
gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible	pp=104.93856510178884
whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr	pp=52.15029001763848
with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed	pp=297.2422832009326
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself	pp=182.33851838461177
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr	pp=92.01437681860376
they will join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with youmr	pp=378.0624098735304
bingley and his sisters	pp=1.2414061715090063
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr	pp=53.56938567537232
they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mrs	pp=25.58228103487865
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected	pp=48.313609354512614
there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming	pp=102.10790511443557
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable	pp=33.334962284217106
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning	pp=40.30392867418052
from what we have seen of him continued mrs	pp=15.740970780330647
on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks	pp=168.70276331141423
and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart	pp=97.99211461864802
in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on mrs	pp=197.6302327056028
gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else	pp=100.52712844232443
darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	pp=90.89780330820545
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came	pp=159.52826969688283
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	pp=295.89164445703244
he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done to mr and mrs	pp=117.74228437906537
the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention	pp=171.20332975615815
but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane	pp=69.13322722639175
there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning	pp=90.03700810983213
gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country	pp=43.19760377434984
eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress	pp=150.89461991744494
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs	pp=7.319287980165838
darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her	pp=15.941347805760108
they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for mr darcy	pp=188.48733368672384
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight	pp=178.59328125092415
she certainly did not hate him	pp=18.38374112748049
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced	pp=254.42571485405148
such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined	pp=188.0557428114618
she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	pp=136.96549022579904
in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs	pp=71.53434718086672
annesley a genteel agreeablelooking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mrs	pp=143.23657332387117
she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine	pp=182.1866186012734
gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning	pp=135.3791070492429
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps	pp=267.47302897975584
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement	pp=129.83013369150797
darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behaviour and dress	pp=151.6664942040252
when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister	pp=54.627901367783494
for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her	pp=74.1886154773887
her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines	pp=105.26703885639422
her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them	pp=149.74084171469985
they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable	pp=187.3308896061388
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention	pp=104.15025689734344
they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs	pp=130.5052174467011
elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill	pp=124.39706861437688
to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected	pp=28.70752150460866
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon	pp=64.54479147179624
i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother	pp=28.31889159682346
dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed	pp=48.36887264924393
never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f	pp=88.60242563320405
intending to trace their route	pp=12.663470095828332
but no one can throw any blame on them	pp=98.27500586099829
i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu	pp=236.35456243723357
i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible	pp=92.85415710766134
you are not well enoughyou cannot go yourself	pp=190.30008361707445
no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself	pp=58.502720727711036
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	pp=41.71520109744823
darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence	pp=188.41568775597617
at length she spoke again	pp=16.365345793513487
i have not the smallest hope	pp=9.013018777330453
he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy	pp=133.0589568448664
it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain	pp=106.69825747429955
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty	pp=343.2256634861058
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey	pp=219.63131599233947
her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object	pp=110.63399636460689
gardiner readily promised every assistance in his powerelizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled	pp=338.6396593924157
but what is to be done about pemberley cried mrs gardiner	pp=29.8299191368224
_that_ is all settled	pp=2.151104047500869
and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was  but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour	pp=248.95439819752752
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure	pp=208.47484837447743
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster	pp=55.22650683894595
do you really think so	pp=10.872855491929634
gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland	pp=18.926320048970368
well thensupposing them to be in london	pp=3.45238218837674
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland	pp=247.3800585800016
but really i know not what to say	pp=4.363573568116708
perhaps i am not doing her justice	pp=33.20362621296321
since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head	pp=96.64371619087697
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greaterwhat shall i call it	pp=89.2226202224018
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman	pp=139.77801568112085
but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is	pp=24.843825094252164
that he has neither integrity nor honour	pp=31.345967674997603
gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	pp=48.47743296918466
till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr	pp=49.34991521763872
and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time	pp=169.76521818318838
that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head	pp=128.83689910931116
from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent	pp=25.222389214938648
not yet replied jane	pp=2.3728644738263553
he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention	pp=49.25646425489224
bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all	pp=41.83318223076648
the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do	pp=83.97170888623015
bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia	pp=164.35805956825172
it is not quite a week since they left brighton	pp=48.809056197283454
and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already _make_ them marry	pp=133.3806510907278
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply	pp=49.11324142529723
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard	pp=192.7100182277185
but not before they went to brighton	pp=15.518624758323021
and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself	pp=16.33501733739939
jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth	pp=64.01612874106486
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham	pp=153.6346114388522
give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey	pp=58.56357905862591
mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them	pp=49.773553925591095
she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us	pp=143.41870099778657
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter	pp=89.01696710012111
it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham	pp=169.15654681808354
bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him	pp=111.54665436543448
bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr	pp=162.9938500354835
at present we have nothing to guide us	pp=39.570730104471444
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved	pp=163.65746629261446
it was as follows  my dear sir  i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire	pp=183.89430995850805
and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs	pp=142.98787765744018
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family	pp=192.55819002854847
let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence	pp=174.8979858116304
gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	pp=98.32616431957591
a gamester she cried	pp=3.913807806507212
gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world	pp=94.21479440633736
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs	pp=96.18111908547631
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from _that_ though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better	pp=211.23054082042256
it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two when mr	pp=95.0626074315653
it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it	pp=41.97419690402993
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth	pp=45.1065901105402
you may well warn me against such an evil	pp=31.316346130440003
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers tea	pp=41.55768592927329
he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter	pp=54.28538184087002
yes i have had a letter from him by express	pp=16.301940267120283
jane now came up	pp=2.6792936720495946
it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both  then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married  elizabeth read on i have seen them both	pp=103.37967272343535
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care	pp=105.81634440489869
we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve	pp=68.92884931229445
can it be possible that he will marry her	pp=35.32613778633855
complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little	pp=41.449731031969776
money my uncle cried jane what do you mean sir	pp=33.802075311159825
that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before	pp=25.44631802586544
how strange this is and for _this_ we are to be thankful	pp=45.22769662940829
he has children of his own and may have more	pp=17.109104174469714
they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her	pp=55.00024463411745
mary and kitty were both with mrs	pp=18.89919576698901
bennet one communication would therefore do for all	pp=53.99741269942109
after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud mrs	pp=125.9920571254539
i will put on my things in a moment	pp=24.203331158959763
wickham how well it sounds	pp=29.76950365018038
when first mr	pp=9.629912335050308
bennet and the children	pp=4.621196872355098
he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement	pp=69.57965439570023
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her	pp=93.77893491304417
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance	pp=234.8853054065839
darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot	pp=241.6962914313862
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink	pp=66.22486070895603
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance	pp=177.2596355083071
wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army	pp=106.11860155557513
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom	pp=41.47092221710749
the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment	pp=14.524349159971859
but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished	pp=125.29794588177367
lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room	pp=20.25057550593245
their reception from mr	pp=2.565959390564501
she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there	pp=127.8126311326247
she longed to see mrs	pp=16.47230126336981
i only hope they may have half my good luck	pp=60.89962439774717
one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth  lizzy i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding i believe	pp=62.101760469174984
are not you curious to hear how it was managed	pp=85.43025381545489
la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off	pp=34.47037369128026
and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon	pp=124.39865906506327
if youll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight	pp=90.99222388726821
to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open	pp=213.8565382744883
those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable	pp=279.39265772223297
it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been	pp=193.82196468713894
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world	pp=202.261174411959
he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than _we_ had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us	pp=124.27499482402148
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted	pp=53.16359771356808
his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go	pp=92.21942075380636
he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on mr	pp=80.31201919717783
bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage	pp=53.55687454681221
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole	pp=80.63185151020998
you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people	pp=26.33525953260994
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure	pp=92.34374828430582
i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her mr	pp=160.59270337945176
darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding	pp=144.68695529946547
will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him	pp=47.16647681707492
a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing	pp=123.83641954005586
yours very sincerely  m gardiner	pp=32.37289961601843
darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce	pp=276.97059574872793
it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return	pp=86.62963340683054
they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him	pp=64.49341706999888
for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him	pp=26.50477539930158
it was hardly enough but it pleased her	pp=38.51792650369479
_we_ were always good friends and now we are better true	pp=71.85815234405561
are the others coming out	pp=29.853187548446726
i do not know mrs	pp=6.0332669226917615
bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton	pp=33.38822123396252
but of course she did not mention my name to you	pp=17.551915767514384
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had	pp=37.6362746911665
i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two	pp=216.55278992242262
when i last saw her she was not very promising	pp=23.575303807722808
i am very glad you liked her	pp=8.465022708901737
one ought not to repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be	pp=48.622510703100076
yes there was something in _that_ i told you so from the first you may remember	pp=69.97523066689884
oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again	pp=33.478942406255705
i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw	pp=44.27365683277619
bennet very dull for several days	pp=35.490794521206396
one seems so forlorn without them	pp=46.600032282980806
long and the gouldings soon	pp=28.675545197864746
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before	pp=161.05184214049245
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window enter the paddock and ride towards the house	pp=66.68649292775704
there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be	pp=57.16295012076085
darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr	pp=36.88915249053845
he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley	pp=45.156042032648074
he was received by mrs	pp=10.411999968272823
she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so	pp=25.512262847246248
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak	pp=41.81653099526806
bingley since you went away said mrs bennet	pp=5.245255014866618
i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers	pp=31.74152686647913
it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be	pp=66.90931754017589
did you see it	pp=3.7852923774635934
bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bennets manor	pp=116.14475262850436
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them	pp=41.72175218212423
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever	pp=116.71762335009055
they then went away mrs	pp=3.4904395586218167
if he fears me why come hither	pp=86.29577093285533
it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance	pp=159.88264866109773
my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now	pp=59.68133333319316
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time	pp=107.86235992939707
when they repaired to the diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister	pp=119.4947878318449
he was on one side of her mother	pp=7.808849240240485
and on the gentlemens approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper  the men shant come and part us i am determined	pp=175.70775863171838
we want none of them do we	pp=12.728910937251632
annesley is with her	pp=1.9881104906050628
and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty mrs	pp=41.52207157111326
long said so too for i asked her whether you did not	pp=49.99148944598164
i do think mrs	pp=5.316968243818868
lizzy you must not do so	pp=7.232868936752558
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed	pp=72.0450948976133
bingley is comehe is indeed	pp=10.239010081600437
bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them	pp=105.35596509406528
bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter	pp=112.56422639988051
darcy returned within the stated time	pp=23.580588754511712
bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs	pp=32.139224557799956
on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all	pp=219.4762162102194
she will be down in a moment i dare say	pp=12.372307635573664
you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled	pp=34.767292950679575
your tempers are by no means unlike	pp=19.947792139717947
you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income	pp=313.5663819042408
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _me_	pp=102.55527136548007
why he has four or five thousand ayear and very likely more	pp=40.027080392876755
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again  he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty	pp=92.63129290495999
oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see _you_ as happy if there _were_ but such another man for you  if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you	pp=239.5999195664592
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret mrs	pp=36.87614196663346
philips and _she_ ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton	pp=106.75663657923012
bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt	pp=110.43476362159345
go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks	pp=90.546568837671
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waitingwoman was in it	pp=22.661038533167304
as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner  you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither	pp=80.17378437796846
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship	pp=92.86491077311955
it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason	pp=32.58130618564499
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied  the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind	pp=98.0294245049567
because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it	pp=118.0888547524711
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth	pp=27.57728779748125
but the wife of mr	pp=1.1834538769997238
let us sit down	pp=1.3771890814727266
i will not be interrupted	pp=7.971167557196085
is this to be endured but it must not shall not be	pp=31.450316657459698
you _are_ a gentlemans daughter	pp=5.214991397014653
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition	pp=68.92287900894472
tell me once for all are you engaged to him	pp=52.10229768695932
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement	pp=72.30160251068153
i will make no promise of the kind	pp=23.673548526127515
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished	pp=52.23834521651636
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require	pp=117.69881692252494
and i certainly _never_ shall give it	pp=37.79528628257003
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable	pp=128.02271114540957
your ladyship wants mr	pp=4.372344504173801
to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add	pp=98.46605169840021
is _her_ husband is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother	pp=65.16302794997918
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody	pp=168.08158441330335
no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy	pp=69.84069250284018
i shall now know how to act	pp=23.950693909432005
do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified	pp=80.09639204696792
lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy	pp=233.46617957097905
and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had looked forward to as possible at some future time	pp=287.85792790165283
lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way	pp=109.13742846115821
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs	pp=151.626062201245
bennets curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject	pp=62.6170647085172
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down	pp=56.496170339629565
this letter is from mr collins from mr	pp=21.291939733616616
what relates to yourself is as follows	pp=21.336019768991466
can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this	pp=107.47809680706229
we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye _mr	pp=77.54071051957649
darcy_ you see is the man now lizzy i think i _have_ surprised you	pp=124.07483205088509
you are not going to be _missish_ i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report	pp=85.63469078642221
bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them	pp=150.356983735388
they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other	pp=55.14075999724725
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said  mr	pp=134.79652657204252
i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness	pp=204.43693373674375
let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them	pp=93.80362434336317
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny	pp=95.44033222610022
if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once	pp=92.1418800208441
the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	pp=126.02385314750276
after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations	pp=164.4036125279992
for though your accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof	pp=393.3566290221107
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did	pp=87.93722334402237
i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary	pp=32.68702745568847
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me	pp=282.180909403287
the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so	pp=114.92358372402184
i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit	pp=181.81672637098382
unfortunately an only son for many years an only _child_ i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own	pp=246.4121619995286
had you then persuaded yourself that i should	pp=35.921355612208785
hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction	pp=92.57613849238028
